# Task 1 - Gather data
To gather data about the top five hot topics in a city, I found news portals to be the most relevant source. Therefore, I scraped Times of India to search for any news related to the city and extracted the titles. Although I attempted to gather data from other sources, including Google Trends, I found that they didn't provide relevant data. Hence, I decided to stick to the news portal for now.

# Task 2 - Gather relevant discussions
After obtaining the news titles, I searched for these topics on Twitter and extracted all the posts and their comments. To ensure comprehensive coverage and a substantial dataset, I scraped data from all available sources on Twitter. Finally, I stored the collected data in a JSON file.
