So that leads to three scenarios that I can think of:\n\n1. Chinese passport checks for visas are a lot less stringent than most people think. I doubt this, as China takes such things VERY seriously.\n\n2. The people with the fakes had a connecting flight straight away or within 48 hours. I'd assume it would be easy enough to check booked tickets out of Beijing against passport numbers/names.\n\n3. The people with the stolen/fake passports never expected to reach Chinese emigration.\n\nNot sure if any of what I'm thinking is true, but the whole thing is just weird...\n\nEdit: So this update clears it all up:\n\nUPDATE 7:38 AM GMT: It is confirmed with China Southern that 'Maraldi' and 'Kozel' (passengers with stolen passports) bought their tickets together and were both due to fly onto Amsterdam.",

I don't remember which plane but I remember when a plane lost air pressure and did this thing where it flies in a spiral down. It's controlled and everything but it's to get to a lower altitude where the pressure difference isn't so much.

This is because things like storms and ships can cause large waves that might trigger a false positive, and also because by the point that an earthquake causes the actual \"tsunami wave\" on the ocean surface it's usually too late to perform evacuations. Instead, tsunami buoys use pressure recorders to monitor the sea floor for seismic activity, sea level changes, or abrupt spikes in oceanic pressure. The \"buoy\" part (what you see bobbing on the water) is actually just the communications relay to transmit the data to a forecast center (in China's case, the State Oceanographic Agency). \n\nA plane crash would barely even register as a blip to a tsunami buoy unless the plane happened to hit the water EXTREMELY close or right on top of one (which, given the size of the sea relative to the number of buoys deployed, would be like you or I getting struck by lightning randomly).",

            "Commenting in response to this comment since the original was deleted (basically asking why all the media attention) - \n\nThere are a few reasons why this is not just a regular plane crash (statistically speaking, plane crashes are hardly regular). I think the intense focus on this event is due to not so much the \"what\" of the event as the \"why\" and the \"how\".\n\n\nThe circumstances are extremely mysterious. The 777 has a stellar safety record and at that point in time the plane had been on cruise control, the safest portion of any flight. Incidents typically happen upon takeoff or on landing. If the plane had run into technical issues, even serious ones, the pilots would have made contact with air control. If something so serious caused the plane to blow up in the air, what could it have been?\n\nThat throws suspicion on the possibility of terrorism. Given the number of Chinese citizens on the plane, speculation is revolving around the possibility that Uighur activists may have been responsible. That, too, seems unlikely given that at this point we have not heard anything about any group claiming responsibility.\n\n\nThe media is focusing on this because it could have serious implications, if not political, then on safety issues for the 777 and other commercial airlines. Not to mention the terrible human tragedy of losing the 239 people who boarded that flight that day.\n\nFor me, personally, I have flown across Southeast Asia many, many times and I can't believe how this could have happened. My heart breaks for the people on the flight, and their family members and friends. It could have been any one of us. As a result, all of us are looking for answers, and closure.",

Staticky but non-panicked radio contact was made shortly before their disappearance by another plane and no distress calls were received, indicating that whatever happened was rather sudden.  The Vietnam Navy confirmed the crash location despite no visible wreckage being found.  \n\nBased off what we know, it's my suspicion that the plane suffered a catastrophic failure of the structure and broke apart at altitude.   A seemingly similar incident has already occurred where a China Airlines B747 (Flight 611) suddenly disappeared from ATC radar.  In that case it was determined that the plane broke apart at altitude by examining primary radar data and observing a starburst pattern emanating from the blip that used to be the plane around the location that ATC radars had made last contact. I would be interested in seeing a log of primary radar for the area of MH370 because a loss of power (777s shouldn't ever lose power to their transponders in flight, even with a double engine failure) could cause a plane to disappear from transponder-based solutions. \n\nPrimary radar is far more primitive (it bounces radio off of anything and everything instead of receiving from a transponder) and could possibly reveal some information about what may have happened.  ATC towers usually do have access to it but don't use it often because it provides no altitude data. Oh, and a final note: Dynasty 611 was difficult to locate and had very little visible wreckage because it spread over a very large area on its way down from cruise altitude.  611 crashed because of poor maintenance.\n\n**TL;DR:  Based on the information so far, I think MH370 suffered a catastrophic structural failure and disintegrated at altitude.  Compare to the case of China Airlines 611.**\n\n**EDIT: Another possibility is a crash analogous to Air France 447, which disappeared into the Atlantic without a trace north of Brazil.**",

Passport photos are hidden under holograms and usually another copy is printed onto the paper underneath the writing itself. That's going to be pretty hard to change, so IMO the people who used the passports would have to look similar enough to the photos to pass for that person. Maybe I'll turn out to be wrong, but I don't think it's adding fuel to the fire. Especially now that we know the two tickets were bought at the same time. It's far too suspicious. ",

            "I understand that there are a huge amount of safety features baked into the design.  I do hope you're not trying to argue that the crashes I've talked about didn't happen, because ignoring them is a good way to allow things like that to happen again.   It's one thing to say that \"planes don't disintegrate\" and suite another to say their structure is incapable of failing.  Please do enlighten me more on the subject if you have some sort of design source that illustrates a 777 can survive a nosedive from 30000 feet, because that's really pushing the limits of physics.\n\nBy \"catastrophic structural failure\" I mean to say that the wings, horizontal stabilizers, or vertical stabilizer separated from the fuselage in some form of overstress event.  It's happened before on a 747 - a design that is very safe too.  The design wasn't the problem; maintenance was.  I don't know what planes you design or what company you work for, but I would not feel safe on a plane that's designed by overly confident engineers and I hope that you feel the same.  Every design has a limit, especially when it isn't maintained right.  \n\nCAL 611 did not disintegrate immediately.  It broke into a few pieces at altitude and small pieces broke off as those pieces began to disintegrate during their descent.  That's the only way primary radar could have seen the starburst.  The big pieces hit the water and mostly sank while many of the smaller items did float.  All in all, ~15% of the wreck was recovered.\n\nEDIT If a plane suffers a catastrophic structural failure as I've described, I can show a multitude of instances where the airplane breaks completely apart while still in flight.  GLO 1907 is a good starting point - it had part of it's left wing clipped off by the winglet of a passing Embraer.  After a short while, the 737-8 broke apart.\nAIC 182, a 747-200 met quick end when its structure failed subsequent to a bombing over the atlantic.  The same thing happened to PAA 103 (old 747-100) over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.  They may be rare, but just as crashes are rare, structural failures still happen.  It's quite rare for a significantly structurally damaged airplane to make a landing at all, let alone a safe one.  The only incident that comes to my mind where that happened is the famous near-crash of AAH 243, which had its roof peel back in flight.  ",
            "Is there a source stating contact from another plane was false? There were several articles interviewing that pilot contacting 370. Not sure who's telling the truth anymore!",
            "CAL 611 broke up almost instantaneously, as tends to happen when a major failure occurs at ~35,000 feet (the plane deviated from its plan and ascended shortly before suffering the failure).\n\nThe lack of oil slick is puzzling though.  CAL 611's wreckage was found on land up to 130 km from the point of breakup and left bodies and oil on the water. If this crash occurred in a similar way, it would presumably be evident and contained completely in the South China Sea.  It is possible for the bodies to sink if the water is cold enough.  That's rather doubtful given the latitude of the sea.  I'm making the assumption that the still floating pieces of wreckage and the bodies are small and dispersed widely enough that they are difficult to spot from the air.\n\nWhat makes me think it's not something else is that if it were a crash similar to AFR 447 which stalled into the Atlantic and disappeared for two years, radar would have caught the descent (possibly not if ATC was using ancient equipment).  If it were like the final dive of ASA 261 which had a mechanical failure at low altitude and nosedived into the Pacific off the California coast, the 777 airframe would've overstressed from the speed and broken apart before hitting the water.  There really aren't any other ways for a plane to simply disappear at altitude like that.  It's nearly impossible for a structurally intact 777 to lose power to its transponder, and that wouldn't hide the plane from primary radar.  A final and unthinkable possibility is a crash like that of MSR 990: a controlled and deliberate flight into the sea.\n\nIt certainly didn't land, either.  Nobody wouldn't question a mysterious 777 that appeared from nowhere on radar and landed at an airport not listed on a flight plan.  And there aren't many places that can accommodate a plane like that anyway.  If something caused them to land at an airfield, the crew surely would've alerted the airline.  That leaves only a few possibilities for what happened, and of those I still suspect a mid-air breakup is the most likely.\n\nI didn't know of the contact being disproven.  Either way, the lack of comms is highly unusual.",
            "Actually, the wreckage wouldn't be exactly where it lost contact.\n\nThe plane is moving at a considerable speed - 470ish knots. The position it lost contact would mean the planes debris (IF an explosion happened) would be considerably farther ahead. Not only that, but at that altitude, winds are in the tens to hundreds of miles per hour - debris would rain a considerable distance.\n\nWhich actually makes the fact that no debris have been found more puzzling - IF it exploded or disintegrated in air, the debris field would be spread over a wide area. So far, nothing has been found - which suggests it is concentrated in a smaller area.",

            "If you only count spontaneous failure of the structure of a plane due to design faults, that stopped happening to airliners in the early '50s with the DH Comets' square window problem.  Other design faults have caused complete hull losses for sure - the 737's rudder hard over problem is a good and recent example. But lots of things can damage the structure and otherwise cause failure, including fires, poor maintenance, and explosions.  These are things that all planes generally aren't designed to withstand and so it is completely understandable that it would cause parts of the plane to separate.  That *is* a structural failure, albeit one that is induced.  I didn't allude too strongly to the cause of my theory on MH370's demise.  I'm under the impression that the airline is performing proper maintenance checks and is reasonably proactive, but I really don't know.  \n\nIt could've been anything: a bombing, a maintenance problem, a design fault, a mid-air collision with a GA aircraft not equipped with a transponder even (how's *that* for a doubtful scenario?).  A structure that is weakened by whatever cause will be easier to overstress and sometimes impossible not to if the plane is no longer capable of flight.  It's not as if 777s are designed to handle the loads that would be present during a 30,000 foot plunge at any rate, at least with the assumption that the wings are generating lift.

I know there was a lot of panicking going on, and I'm sure there are more issues at work than that, but it's always seemed a bit confusing to me why they weren't able to just try to reset the controls to how they were before the pitot tubes froze up and they lost speed info. Is it just because now things are computerized pilots just set a speed target and don't need to concentrate so much on what throttle level is actually used to maintain that?",

            ">Who the pulls back on the stick during a stall?\n\nI recall a very detailed thread somewhere where a pilot with Airbus experience went into a lot of detail about what happens to the instruments when the pitot tube is blocked. His explanation made the pilots' behavior a little more understandable.\n\nI can't find that thread,  but here's [an article with similar information](http://www.avweb.com/news/airman/184279-1.html?redirected=1).  The key points:\n\n~~**Altimeter:**~~ \n~~>\"An altimeter affected by a blocked static system will simply **continue to show the same reading** it had when the blockage occurred.\"~~  \n\nEDIT:  I read the article again a little more closely,  and it said the altimeter would not be affected by a frozen pitot tube.  \n\n**Air Speed Indicator:** \n>Should the pitot tube become suddenly blocked ... it would probably go unnoticed in level flight. In a climb or a descent, however, **an airspeed indicator relying on a blocked pitot tube would behave like an altimeter**. ... As you climb, the static pressure will become less, the trapped pitot pressure will remain the same, and the increasing difference between the two would be shown as increasing airspeed. \n\nNotice what it said about the air speed indicator:  as the plane climbed it showed the airspeed increasing.\n\nSo the pilot was operating the controls in such a way as to make the airspeed indicator increase.  Which really is the desired effect when stall warnings are being shouted.  ~~And the altimeter wasn't changing its reading,  so the pilot was not aware he was climbing.~~  EDIT:  see comment above.\n\nYour point is still valid:  well-trained pilots should still know that you just can't pull back on the stick for a couple of solid minutes when a stall is imminent.  And when the senior pilot on board figured out what the guy flying was doing,  he freaked out,  took over the controls himself,  and started doing the right things.  But by then it was too late.\n\nBut I think it is a very interesting nugget of information that is rarely reported in articles about the crash:  the stuff the pilot did in the cockpit was probably making the airspeed indicator increase.  He very likely had a reason for what he did.\n",

            "They won't confirm anything I think, not until they have found the aircraft. I am just using educated guesses.\n\nIt's hard to answer because things could have failed very quickly and in a big way, this is my bet from what I know. So if there was a catastrophic failure and the plane broke apart, then everything breaks. \n\nIf you took a sledge hammer to your PC, then it's likely you would lose it's Internet access. From experience the main cause of this information not to be sent and a complete loss of communications is a break up in flight, it would cause everything to fail.\n\nThere is massive redundancy, sure there could be events that cause the all transponders to fail and other systems as well but these are unlikely, it looks more like everything failed in a very quick moment.   \n\nIf that total failure did not happen, then MA has some data more than likely, they get the telemetry of all primary systems and their status, altitude, airspeed, attitude, heading, engine status, fuel levels, all alarms basically a great deal of data from over 100 sensors.\n\nThese are sent in snapshots that can be changed, on my aircraft it's 30 seconds, some operators are longer and can be 15 minutes, this can be also be changed remotely and on a sensor by sensor basis, turning some on in real time. Some serious alarms are sent immediately as well. \n\nSome operators don't do this but these are generally smaller regional firms, I would highly suspect MA does. \n \nWhole problem with these accidents is everyone keeps quiet until they have a fuller picture, what makes it hard is even if you have some position information when contact was lost (and they 100% do due to ADS-B), the plane was 7 miles high, even a few degrees change in heading can make a lot of difference to where it ends up.\n\nYes they should have some better data unless the aircraft blew apart and caused everything to fail. If a plane vanishes from radar, something is really wrong. In case you don't know, ATC's radar normally doesn't scan the skies and looks for targets that bounce back, it's normally a listening station that gets transponder messages from the aircraft. The fact this just vanished like the transponder has been turned off, again points to a complete aircraft failure.  \n\nIf that is the case, now they will be looking for the beacons for the flight data recorders, these can transmit over a month.  \n\n ",

I'm just not sure what the problem with dropping the nose to 0 degrees angle of attack and even throttling back, if you really think overspeed is an issue, would have been.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\ntemporary inconsistency between the measured speeds, likely as a result of the obstruction of the pitot tubes by ice crystals, causing autopilot disconnection and reconfiguration to alternate law;\nthe crew made inappropriate control inputs that destabilized the flight path;\nthe crew failed to follow appropriate procedure for loss of displayed airspeed information;\nthe crew were late in identifying and correcting the deviation from the flight path;\nthe crew lacked understanding of the approach to stall;\nthe crew failed to recognize that the aircraft had stalled and consequently did not make inputs that would have made it possible to recover from the stall.\n",

Cemeteries are just wastes of useful land. \n\nAdmire/revere/remember people for what's inside their skull, not the skull itself. ",

This is confirmed as wrong.\n* Photo of a young man, crushed by armed police vehicle. This is also confirmed wrong. The photo belongs to a boat motor accident.\n* Access to social media sites are banned. Although in Taksim, Istanbul 3G access is banned, social media sites can not be accessed because of the traffic.\n* Thousands of police officers have resigned. This is also confirmed wrong, about 20 or 30 police officers confirmed to be resigned.\n* Head of the Istanbul Police Headquarters has resigned. Confirmed wrong, as a fake Twitter account spread it.\n* Police using real bullets. If they have used real bullet, this is massacre not intervention.\n* A protester who tried to stop an armed vehicle has died. No, he is alive. A fake identity had given to him, in order to make people believe that he is dead.\n* Police officers spraying tear gas to dogs. This photo is not from Turkey, it is from Italy since \"Policia\" is written on the backs of polices instead of \"Polis\".\n* Besiktas supporters claimed one of the armed vehicles. This was unconfirmed last night and before that. Now it is known that it is not true.\n* Police officers fainted protesters with chemical water. Tens of thousands people had shared this in social media but this is not true.\n* News channels' fake twitter accounts. There are many fake accounts of Turkish news channels.\n* If the protest lasts 48 hours, Turkish Constitutional Court have the right to cancel the current government. This is also not true, it was a made-up rumor in order to make protests last longer.\n* Agent Orange used in protests. Agent Orange is a chemical which can simply massacre tons of protesters. It was a report in CNN's iReport site but in iReport site, users reports their own views.\n* Beyazit Ozturk's show cancelled permanently because of his own cancellation. Beyazit only cancelled this week's program.\n* 2012 Eurasia Marathon's photos used for yesterday mornings cross of the Bogazici Bridge. There were some true photos, but some of the photos belonged to last year's marathon.\n* CNN International had terminated their contract with CNN Turk. We are hoping that they will terminate, but for now this is only a hoax.\n* Protesters attacked women who were wearing turban.

It's possible they would have still gone red given what happened in Miami-Dade, but it wouldn't have been by the margins we saw on election night. Georgia also has a gerrymandered map that all but assured that the results would be 9 R, 5 D (it used to be 8 R, 6 D before the redraw in 2020). I could go on...\n\nMost Dem states did not have as heavily gerrymandered maps, either because the courts rejected them (looking at you New York) or because they rely on nonpartisan commissions to draw the maps instead of partisan state legislatures. \n\nFocus on New York for just a second: Because Dems did not gerrymander that map as hard as they wanted to, Republicans were able to make several pickups there. It's a good thing because it means that voters are able to pick their representatives (which is how our democracy should function), but it also means that Dems played fairly while Republicans did not. \n\nAnd so, Republicans just barely getting control of the House is frankly embarrassing given all these factors.",

            "Okay, I think I'm going to post a bit about Uvalde because there are so many misconceptions about this town on this site that it really bothers me. For background, my family is from Uvalde, my grandparents live two blocks behind Robb Elementary, and we're probably fifth or sixth generation Mexican Americans dating back to Texas's revolution. I didn't grow up in the town, my dad did, I did spend every summer there growing up, and go back every Christmas or Thanksgiving. I lay this out to be clear that while I am very familiar with the community, I do not live there and any one who does feel free to correct anything I post.\n\nFirst of all, there are two main demographics in Uvalde. Whites and Mexican Americans, the Mexican Americans I will focus the most on because I think this portion of the population is most misunderstood by reddit and the internet at large.\n\nThe *vast* majority of Mexican Americans in this town are also fifth and sixth generation like my own family. This means that they are very Americanized and may not act how many of you expect. For a small example, the town itself is *not* pronounced by them the way TV anchors do it. You will not hear anyone there call it Oo-vall-deh but U-vahl-day. Yep, just like how white people say it.\n\nUvalde has many farms, ranches, and deer leases in or around it. If you do not work for or own any of these land types, you know someone who does. Many of the people who live or work or have connections to these places use guns every single day for work, to protect livestock, or for food during hunting season.\n\nUvalde is close to the border. While many people here do not hate illegal immigrants, they also are not particularly open to them either. The Mexican Americans here have issues with any perceived crimes that may or may not be committed by illegal immigrants. They don't want to see them mistreated necessarily, but they are also not of the mind that illegal immigrants are their \"people\" in the sense that immigrants are a make or break it voting issue for them.\n\nFollowing this point, Uvalde does not hate Border Patrol. They're actually very neutral towards it, and it is not uncommon for them to seek a career in their ranks. A few of the responding Border Patrol agents at Robb grew up in Uvalde.\n\nWhat do the people of Uvalde believe in? The *are* conservative in that many of their industry and livelihoods are aligned with conservative values. As farmers and ranchers, they are going to vote in the interests of gun rights and land ownership.\n\nMany Mexican Americans in Uvalde are culturally Catholic, and a significant amount attend mass. Abortion is not going to be a make or break issue for them this cycle because they already lean against it anyway. However, they tend not to be the fire and brimstone evangelical type of conservative. Machismo culture is common in older generations, but is waning among younger people here.\n\nUvalde does not trust its police department. This is something the internet kind of got right. They are not happy, and are acting more belligerent towards its officers than before, or they were when I last spoke with my family.\n\nHowever, this is where I think the breakdown happens on how reddit believes Uvalde should respond. They are not going to vote against their own gun rights. Many of the people here do not give a flying fuck about Greg Abbott in their day to day lives. The govenor does not affect them, in their minds, on this granular of a level. Unless said governor started to campaign against guns.\n\nBecause, one, they are still culturally and practically attached to guns on a significant level. Their response to further threats against their community is to arm *themselves,* tell the police to fuck off, and handle community threats and breakdowns the same way they always have.\n\nOn their own.\n\nWhen talking about the shooter, a lot of emphasis is placed on his family. Where were they? Why were his parents such failures? His grandmother did the best she could. Ect. Mexican Americans in particular in Uvalde handle issues with individuals within the family. It is a common belief that if his parents were in his life, maybe we wouldn't be here. I'm not going to say whether that view is correct or not, I'm providing it here to highlight that Uvalde is very self-reliant in this manner. They view the police as having failed them, so they are going to take care of themselves.\n\nWith all this said, Uvalde was *never* going to vote in masse for Beto because of his stance on guns. Abortion, the environment, property taxes, *none* of these things were their big ticket issue this election.\n\nGuns were.\n\nAgree with them or not, Uvalde is considered a \"large\" town in its area because it's pretty much the largest town or city between itself and San Antonio. As it grew, it was self reliant and independent on most its needs as it developed. It is not and probably will never be a blue county and will not vote the way reddit or twitter or any left leaning social media site expects or wishes them to.\n\nThey are in many ways a conservative people in the same manner old school conservatives once were before radicals gained control of the GOP. The Mexican Americans here are by *no means* Trump or QAnon psychos the way current Republicans are. But they are not a left leaning people either.\n\nDemocrats can reach them and more parts of Texas if they field a candidate who is more realistic to Texas's cowboy, independent, rugged past and mythos.\n\nI'm sure there are even more facets to how this vote turned out, but I wanted to post what I know of Uvalde because I am so fucking sick of ignorant posts (not so much this parent post) on this site and elsewhere posting complete bullshit about Uvalde, and for what? Upvotes? Clout? Because I don't spot true empathy in them. If there were, they'd bother to learn at least *a little* about who they are. So many people have never been here or spoken to anyone from Uvalde, and it's frustrating to read bad takes about them.",

Harper has another component: while Congress might be able to overrule state legislatures in setting the rules for elections, state courts cannot.

            "So, there's a couple things at play here.  \n  \nLong story short, the midterms almost always result in a loss of seats for the party that holds the Presidency, and it's just a question of by how big the loss is.  At least in the modern political era there has only been one exception to this which is 2002 where the Democrats got completely wiped out because W had the 9/11 boost on his side, and there was a huge rally around the flag effect.  \n  \nOn top of that, Republican voters typically show up to midterms more often than Democrat voters, this has been the case basically since the 60's when you started getting the current day liberal/conservative splits in the parties.  The first time this effect hasn't been since since the days of LBJ's presidency was the 2018 midterms and now the 2022 midterms (I'm not sure on exact turnout yet, but early voting which is mostly Democrats broke 2018 records).  \n  \nAs such, as we went into midterms which are traditionally bad for Democrats for the previously mentioned reasons, there is a Democrat president which gives Republicans a boost.  Then Biden isn't really someone people are enthusiastic about, and largely ambivalent towards for his supporters which suppresses Democrat turnout, he's simply not a guy who generates hype.  \n  \nOn top of these issues you have national problems going on right now.  There is near double digit inflation happening which is normally a huge political issue (inflation ended Carters political career as well as Bush Sr, worries of inflation hamstrung Clinton, and fears of inflation both lead to the 2008 Obama supermajority and the subsequent wipeout of Democrats in each election after).  Then you have high gas prices, which are again a sensitive issue to people.  \n  \nOutside of highly visible issues like mentioned, the last two years have seen unprecedented levels of voter suppression measures taken.  Pennsylvania threw out a bunch of mail in ballots without telling people the day before election day, then forbid those people from voting in person.  Several districts had no process in place to resolve this.  Florida engaged in disenfranchisement by violating their felon voting rights reform, and then arresting people they said could vote.  Texas used a one size fits all approach to polling places, giving precincts of a couple thousand people the same numbers of machines, space, and poll workers as precincts with a 100,000 voters, and so on.  And of course there is the gerrymandered map issue such as states like Ohio and North Carolina which defended their redrawn districts in court, with the defense that the intent was to prevent Democrats from voting and winning elections, citing a SCOTUS ruling that drawing districts in a way to generate a partisan advantage is constitutional.   \n  \nAll of these things should have resulted in an absolute bloodbath for Democrats, and a huge win for Republicans.  Because of this, it's not really the end result that is being measured here, but rather that result against expectations based on the above as well as things such as polling data.    \n  \nTo say Republicans did bad in this election is an understatement.  They under performed relative to expectations by such a historically bad amount, that this is one of the worst election results in their parties history.  \n  \nThere's not really enough data in yet to give exact reasons (there's a lot of reasons, but how much each impacted voters is tough to say right now), but prior to last night, Republicans having 60 in the Senate and 260 in the House was legitimately on the table if they had a good night.  Instead they're in almost the same spot they were before the election, in what should have been a very favorable election for them.  \n  \nAnd that's before we get into the governor elections which was a another historically bad turnout for Republicans.  Republicans have held a huge advantage in gubernatorial races for decades, so much so that a major long term policy goal of the party was to control enough of those offices that they could call a convention of states and control the outcome.  They have been within striking distance of it multiple times.  Not a single incumbent lost their seat in elections this year, but all non incumbents went to Democrats, resulting in a gain of either 2 or 3 seats for Democrats (I think there's still one undecided looking at the results).  \n  \nPolling, political climate, timing, and so on should have had Republicans gain a large majority in the House and Senate while likely gaining a governor or two.  Instead they lost governor seats, aren't getting the Senate (and maybe even losing seats), and are getting what's looking to be an extremely narrow majority in the House.  As far as results go for Republicans, this is awful.  Oh, they lost several state legislatures too.\nEdit:  Couple small edits to add some more historical context that puts the shifts into perspective.",

I just don't get why they live and die on it in this state, that is notorious for its gun ownership.\n\nDo I believe that gun safety measures are the most direct way to prevent further school shooting?

It means democrats can move lockstep on any extreme rightwing position find ANY holdouts among 200 some odd Republicans and block things before they even hit the senate. Its a lot easier to do that when you need 1-10 people as opposed to like 20-30.\n\nMore so it shows voters aren't so furious at Democrats as they are cautious and distrustful of Republicans.

On the one hand the person might close their nose and vote for Walker, but then again they could have done that the first time around.\n\n2. Some are pro-freedom for everything, and thus have no candidate since Warnock dislikes some of those freedoms and Walker apparently partakes in some of the ones he allegedly wants to curtail. They're likely to just ignore the race.\n\n3. Some are single issue voters (weed, guns, etc.) and thus may go for the \"second best\" candidate on that issue. I don't believe Warnock is all that interested in weed legalization for instance, but Republicans generally don't care at least and want to treat it as a nasty concoction at the most.\n\n4. They just hate the two candiidates for some reason and wanted someone closer to their values (\"I hate Christian extremists like the anti-choicer and the Reverend!\")\n\n5. \"Um, I think I picked the wrong guy by mistake.\" This is allegedly a major reason W won the 2000 Florida election.\n\nThere's a bunch of other factors that have nothing to do with the Libertarian (Georgia might matter for the Senate control again, Kemp is no longer lifting Walker's boat as a running mate of sorts), but the truth is that Libertarians are not Republican-lite.

Dems gained 2 governors, flipped the PA state house, both houses in MI, and MN senate. Doing so has gained them full control (\"trifecta\") of 4 more states. \n\nIt's also not entirely out of the question that they might gain the NH House - at the very least it's effectively a dead heat now and will be very hard to pass anything on pure party lines.

The fact that polling suggested a red wave was bad enough. Democrats loosing control of chambers to the Republican Party in its current state should be worrying and cause for some introspection. \n\nThe same can be said for republicans though too tbh.

I see what you're saying about them not yet voting rationally, but in my mind it was the opposite. The grief is still very raw and fresh and I thought it would be at the forefront of people's minds when making such an important decision. Even when we remove the approach taken by Beto regarding guns from the equation, I struggle to find any defense given the callousness in which Abbott talked about the tragedy. \n\nI agree. The Democrats would do better with simpler and more concise messaging. They lose and confuse people by not communicating clearly. I think too they assume that the average person is tuned into everything going on, when that is not the case.

As I said, the rules serve as a comparative floor on experience level, it's in some ways an insurance policy to make sure that that institutional experience stays above a minimum level, not a target they were aiming for.\n\nA useful counter-example here is state legislatures, many of which also have Senate's, but often with different rules. Missouri, for example, passed Term Limits for it's legislature recently, and among other effects that notably capped the experience level of legislators in the state, which has had pretty clear effects on both the sort of legislation getting considered and the process of getting that legislation passed, since many of those term-limited legislators are from low population districts where there just aren't that many people *willing* to take the job, let alone good at it.",

If people are willing to accept what the powers that be tells them it is, rather than speaking up and questioning the powers that be on why it is, then I see nothing but a bleak future if Democrats retain the house and senate. \n\nAlso: [https://redstate.com/streiff/2022/10/31/leaked-documents-show-dhs-the-fbi-and-social-media-platforms-worked-together-to-stop-debate-on-covid-hunters-laptop-and-election-integrity-n652011](https://redstate.com/streiff/2022/10/31/leaked-documents-show-dhs-the-fbi-and-social-media-platforms-worked-together-to-stop-debate-on-covid-hunters-laptop-and-election-integrity-n652011)\n\nI'm done for the day, going to focus on enjoying my day.

You do know the Senate confirms judges right? \n\nThe Republicans not passing any major policies like a nationwide abortion ban was a forgone conclusion. Of course Biden will veto any bills he doesn\u2019t like. Any high school kid already knew that. \n\nCongress hold the purse strings and decides who becomes judges.

The problem is the dumbest most gullible demographic in America (that isn\u2019t medically classified as disabled), and that as a country we have failed to reinforce their intelligence effectively enough to equip them with critical thinking. The solution is multifaceted, it will require major reinforcement of education in regions where this gullible demographic is reproducing, as well as research into the potential causes for their lack of intellect, compulsion to make things up, and susceptibility to things that other people just make up. For example in regions where this gullibility is prevalent, studying whether there is a history of lead pipes or other chemical poisoning that leads to low IQ. Further, there should be legal consequences for people who intentionally take advantage of the gullible/low IQ demographic by tricking them into believing things that are made up, and subsequently leading them to be violent, scamming them out of money, or encouraging them to overthrow democratically elected representatives."
