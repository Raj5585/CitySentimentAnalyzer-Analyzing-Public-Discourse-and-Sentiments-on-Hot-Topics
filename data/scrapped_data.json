DeSantis pretty much drew the map for Florida, which is why you saw so many seats there flip red. It's possible they would have still gone red given what happened in Miami-Dade, but it wouldn't have been by the margins we saw on election night. Georgia also has a gerrymandered map that all but assured that the results would be 9 R, 5 D (it used to be 8 R, 6 D before the redraw in 2020). I could go on...\n\nMost Dem states did not have as heavily gerrymandered maps, either because the courts rejected them (looking at you New York) or because they rely on nonpartisan commissions to draw the maps instead of partisan state legislatures. \n\nFocus on New York for just a second: Because Dems did not gerrymander that map as hard as they wanted to, Republicans were able to make several pickups there. It's a good thing because it means that voters are able to pick their representatives (which is how our democracy should function), but it also means that Dems played fairly while Republicans did not. \n\nAnd so, Republicans just barely getting control of the House is frankly embarrassing given all these factors.",

            "Okay, I think I'm going to post a bit about Uvalde because there are so many misconceptions about this town on this site that it really bothers me. For background, my family is from Uvalde, my grandparents live two blocks behind Robb Elementary, and we're probably fifth or sixth generation Mexican Americans dating back to Texas's revolution. I didn't grow up in the town, my dad did, I did spend every summer there growing up, and go back every Christmas or Thanksgiving. I lay this out to be clear that while I am very familiar with the community, I do not live there and any one who does feel free to correct anything I post.\n\nFirst of all, there are two main demographics in Uvalde. Whites and Mexican Americans, the Mexican Americans I will focus the most on because I think this portion of the population is most misunderstood by reddit and the internet at large.\n\nThe *vast* majority of Mexican Americans in this town are also fifth and sixth generation like my own family. This means that they are very Americanized and may not act how many of you expect. For a small example, the town itself is *not* pronounced by them the way TV anchors do it. You will not hear anyone there call it Oo-vall-deh but U-vahl-day. Yep, just like how white people say it.\n\nUvalde has many farms, ranches, and deer leases in or around it. If you do not work for or own any of these land types, you know someone who does. Many of the people who live or work or have connections to these places use guns every single day for work, to protect livestock, or for food during hunting season.\n\nUvalde is close to the border. While many people here do not hate illegal immigrants, they also are not particularly open to them either. The Mexican Americans here have issues with any perceived crimes that may or may not be committed by illegal immigrants. They don't want to see them mistreated necessarily, but they are also not of the mind that illegal immigrants are their \"people\" in the sense that immigrants are a make or break it voting issue for them.\n\nFollowing this point, Uvalde does not hate Border Patrol. They're actually very neutral towards it, and it is not uncommon for them to seek a career in their ranks. A few of the responding Border Patrol agents at Robb grew up in Uvalde.\n\nWhat do the people of Uvalde believe in? The *are* conservative in that many of their industry and livelihoods are aligned with conservative values. As farmers and ranchers, they are going to vote in the interests of gun rights and land ownership.\n\nMany Mexican Americans in Uvalde are culturally Catholic, and a significant amount attend mass. Abortion is not going to be a make or break issue for them this cycle because they already lean against it anyway. However, they tend not to be the fire and brimstone evangelical type of conservative. Machismo culture is common in older generations, but is waning among younger people here.\n\nUvalde does not trust its police department. This is something the internet kind of got right. They are not happy, and are acting more belligerent towards its officers than before, or they were when I last spoke with my family.\n\nHowever, this is where I think the breakdown happens on how reddit believes Uvalde should respond. They are not going to vote against their own gun rights. Many of the people here do not give a flying fuck about Greg Abbott in their day to day lives. The govenor does not affect them, in their minds, on this granular of a level. Unless said governor started to campaign against guns.\n\nBecause, one, they are still culturally and practically attached to guns on a significant level. Their response to further threats against their community is to arm *themselves,* tell the police to fuck off, and handle community threats and breakdowns the same way they always have.\n\nOn their own.\n\nWhen talking about the shooter, a lot of emphasis is placed on his family. Where were they? Why were his parents such failures? His grandmother did the best she could. Ect. Mexican Americans in particular in Uvalde handle issues with individuals within the family. It is a common belief that if his parents were in his life, maybe we wouldn't be here. I'm not going to say whether that view is correct or not, I'm providing it here to highlight that Uvalde is very self-reliant in this manner. They view the police as having failed them, so they are going to take care of themselves.\n\nWith all this said, Uvalde was *never* going to vote in masse for Beto because of his stance on guns. Abortion, the environment, property taxes, *none* of these things were their big ticket issue this election.\n\nGuns were.\n\nAgree with them or not, Uvalde is considered a \"large\" town in its area because it's pretty much the largest town or city between itself and San Antonio. As it grew, it was self reliant and independent on most its needs as it developed. It is not and probably will never be a blue county and will not vote the way reddit or twitter or any left leaning social media site expects or wishes them to.\n\nThey are in many ways a conservative people in the same manner old school conservatives once were before radicals gained control of the GOP. The Mexican Americans here are by *no means* Trump or QAnon psychos the way current Republicans are. But they are not a left leaning people either.\n\nDemocrats can reach them and more parts of Texas if they field a candidate who is more realistic to Texas's cowboy, independent, rugged past and mythos.\n\nI'm sure there are even more facets to how this vote turned out, but I wanted to post what I know of Uvalde because I am so fucking sick of ignorant posts (not so much this parent post) on this site and elsewhere posting complete bullshit about Uvalde, and for what? Upvotes? Clout? Because I don't spot true empathy in them. If there were, they'd bother to learn at least *a little* about who they are. So many people have never been here or spoken to anyone from Uvalde, and it's frustrating to read bad takes about them.",

TO come out with just a few seat minority in the house really makes the worst case scenarios of a vengeful kevin mccarthy unattainable. \n\nWe will deal with a few nonsensical things coming out of a bare republican house, and probably a lot of interference with the debt ceiling, but the twice yearly impeachments are probably off the table. I believe that with a 30-40 seat majority they would have filed articles of impeachment nonstop for two years.",
            "The story is not so much the Repubs winning control of at least one house, which was a given, but that the supposed Red Wave never materialized.",
            "So, there's a couple things at play here.  \n  \nLong story short, the midterms almost always result in a loss of seats for the party that holds the Presidency, and it's just a question of by how big the loss is.  At least in the modern political era there has only been one exception to this which is 2002 where the Democrats got completely wiped out because W had the 9/11 boost on his side, and there was a huge rally around the flag effect.  \n  \nOn top of that, Republican voters typically show up to midterms more often than Democrat voters, this has been the case basically since the 60's when you started getting the current day liberal/conservative splits in the parties.  The first time this effect hasn't been since since the days of LBJ's presidency was the 2018 midterms and now the 2022 midterms (I'm not sure on exact turnout yet, but early voting which is mostly Democrats broke 2018 records).  \n  \nAs such, as we went into midterms which are traditionally bad for Democrats for the previously mentioned reasons, there is a Democrat president which gives Republicans a boost.  Then Biden isn't really someone people are enthusiastic about, and largely ambivalent towards for his supporters which suppresses Democrat turnout, he's simply not a guy who generates hype.  \n  \nOn top of these issues you have national problems going on right now.  There is near double digit inflation happening which is normally a huge political issue (inflation ended Carters political career as well as Bush Sr, worries of inflation hamstrung Clinton, and fears of inflation both lead to the 2008 Obama supermajority and the subsequent wipeout of Democrats in each election after).  Then you have high gas prices, which are again a sensitive issue to people.  \n  \nOutside of highly visible issues like mentioned, the last two years have seen unprecedented levels of voter suppression measures taken.  Pennsylvania threw out a bunch of mail in ballots without telling people the day before election day, then forbid those people from voting in person.  Several districts had no process in place to resolve this.  Florida engaged in disenfranchisement by violating their felon voting rights reform, and then arresting people they said could vote.  Texas used a one size fits all approach to polling places, giving precincts of a couple thousand people the same numbers of machines, space, and poll workers as precincts with a 100,000 voters, and so on.  And of course there is the gerrymandered map issue such as states like Ohio and North Carolina which defended their redrawn districts in court, with the defense that the intent was to prevent Democrats from voting and winning elections, citing a SCOTUS ruling that drawing districts in a way to generate a partisan advantage is constitutional.   \n  \nAll of these things should have resulted in an absolute bloodbath for Democrats, and a huge win for Republicans.  Because of this, it's not really the end result that is being measured here, but rather that result against expectations based on the above as well as things such as polling data.    \n  \nTo say Republicans did bad in this election is an understatement.  They under performed relative to expectations by such a historically bad amount, that this is one of the worst election results in their parties history.  \n  \nThere's not really enough data in yet to give exact reasons (there's a lot of reasons, but how much each impacted voters is tough to say right now), but prior to last night, Republicans having 60 in the Senate and 260 in the House was legitimately on the table if they had a good night.  Instead they're in almost the same spot they were before the election, in what should have been a very favorable election for them.  \n  \nAnd that's before we get into the governor elections which was a another historically bad turnout for Republicans.  Republicans have held a huge advantage in gubernatorial races for decades, so much so that a major long term policy goal of the party was to control enough of those offices that they could call a convention of states and control the outcome.  They have been within striking distance of it multiple times.  Not a single incumbent lost their seat in elections this year, but all non incumbents went to Democrats, resulting in a gain of either 2 or 3 seats for Democrats (I think there's still one undecided looking at the results).  \n  \nPolling, political climate, timing, and so on should have had Republicans gain a large majority in the House and Senate while likely gaining a governor or two.  Instead they lost governor seats, aren't getting the Senate (and maybe even losing seats), and are getting what's looking to be an extremely narrow majority in the House.  As far as results go for Republicans, this is awful.  Oh, they lost several state legislatures too.\nEdit:  Couple small edits to add some more historical context that puts the shifts into perspective.",

The Democrats would do better with simpler and more concise messaging. They lose and confuse people by not communicating clearly.

            "*Tuesday, March 25, 12:30 PM MYT +0800 Malaysia Airlines MH370 Flight Incident - Media Statement 25*\n\n**By: Tan Sri Md Nor Md Yusof, Chairman of Malaysia Airlines**\n\nAs you will be aware, last night the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najjib Razak, announced new evidence regarding the disappearance of MH370 on 8th March.\n\nBased on this evidence, the Prime Minister\u2019s message was that we must accept the painful reality that the aircraft is now lost and that none of the passengers or crew on board survived.\n\nThis is a sad and tragic day for all of us at Malaysia Airlines. While not entirely unexpected after an intensive multi-national search across a 2.24 million square mile area, this news is clearly devastating for the families of those on board. They have waited for over two weeks for even the smallest hope of positive news about their loved ones.\n\nThis has been an unprecedented event requiring an unprecedented response. The investigation still underway may yet prove to be even longer and more complex than it has been since March 8th. But we will continue to support the families \u2013 as we have done throughout. And to support the authorities as the search for definitive answers continues. I will now ask our Group Chief Executive\u00b8 Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, to provide you will with fuller details of our support for the families.\n\n**By: Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, Group Chief Executive Officer, Malaysia Airlines**\n\nI stand before you today not only as the Group Chief Executive Officer of Malaysia Airlines, but also as a parent, as a brother, as a son. My heart breaks to think of the unimaginable pain suffered by all the families. There are no words which can ease that pain. Everyone in the Malaysia Airlines family is praying for the 239 souls on MH370 and for their loved ones on this dark day. We extend our prayers and sincere condolences.\n\nWe all feel enormous sorrow and pain. Sorrow that all those who boarded Flight MH370 on Saturday 8th March, will not see their families again. And that those families will now have to live on without those they love.  It must be remembered too that 13 of our own colleagues and fellow Malaysians were also on board. \n\nAnd let me be very clear on the events of yesterday evening. Our sole and only motivation last night was to ensure that in the incredibly short amount of time available to us, the families heard the tragic news before the world did. Wherever humanly possible, we did so in person with the families or by telephone, using SMS only as an additional means of ensuring fully that the nearly 1,000 family members heard the news from us and not from the media.\n\nEver since the disappearance of Flight MH370 Malaysia Airlines\u2019 focus has been to comfort and support the families of those involved and support the multi-national search effort. We will continue to do this, while we also continue to support the work of the investigating authorities in the Southern Indian Ocean.\n\nLike everyone else, we are waiting for news from those authorities. We know that while there have been an increasing number of apparent leads, definitive identification of any piece of debris is still missing. It is impossible to predict how long this will take. But after 17 days, the announcement made last night and shared with the families is the reality which we must now accept. When Malaysia Airlines receives approval from the investigating authorities, arrangements will be made to bring the families to the recovery areas if they so wish. Until that time, we will continue to support the ongoing investigation. And may I express my thanks to the Government and all of those involved in this truly global search effort.\n\nIn the meantime, Malaysia Airlines\u2019 overwhelming focus will be the same as it has been from the outset \u2013 to provide the families with a comprehensive support programme. Through a network of over 700 dedicated caregivers, the loved ones of those on board have been provided with two dedicated caregivers for each family, providing care, support and counsel. We are now supporting over 900 people under this programme and in the last 72 hours, we have trained an additional 40 caregivers to ensure the families have access to round-the-clock support.\n\nIn addition, hotel accommodation for up to five family members per passenger, transportation, meals and others expenses have been provided since 8th March and that will continue.\n\nMalaysia Airlines has already provided initial financial assistance of USD 5,000 per passenger to the next of kin. We recognize that financial support is not the only consideration. But the prolonged search is naturally placing financial strain on the relatives. We are therefore preparing to offer additional payments as the search continues.\n\nThis unprecedented event in aviation history has made the past 18 days the greatest challenge to face our entire team at Malaysia Airlines. I have been humbled by the hard work, dedication, heartfelt messages of concern and offers of support from our remarkable team. We do not know why, and we do not know how this terrible tragedy happened. But as the Malaysia Airlines family, we are all praying for the passengers and crew of Flight MH370.\n\n -end-\n\nNote: Please attribute all quotes to Malaysia Airlines",
            "*Note: Formatting's mine to aid readability*\n\n**INFORMATION PROVIDED TO MH370 INVESTIGATION BY UK AIR ACCIDENTS INVESTIGATION BRANCH (AAIB)** \n\n**25/03/14**\n\nOn 13 March we received information from UK satellite company Inmarsat indicating that routine automatic communications between one of its satellites and the aircraft could be used to determine several possible flight paths.\n\nInmarsat UK has continued to refine this analysis and yesterday the AAIB presented its most recent findings, which indicate that the aircraft flew along the southern corridor.\n\nAs you have heard, an aircraft is able to communicate with ground stations via satellite.\n\nIf the ground station has not heard from an aircraft for an hour it will transmit a 'log on / log off' message, sometimes referred to as a \u2018ping\u2019, using the aircraft\u2019s unique identifier. If the aircraft receives its unique identifier it returns a short message indicating that it is still logged on. This process has been described as a \u201chandshake\u201d and takes place automatically.\n\nFrom the ground station log it was established that after ACARS stopped sending messages, 6 complete handshakes took place.\n\nThe position of the satellite is known, and the time that it takes the signal to be sent and received, via the satellite, to the ground station can be used to establish the range of the aircraft from the satellite. This information was used to generate arcs of possible positions from which the Northern and Southern corridors were established.\n\n**Refined analysis from Inmarsat**\n\nIn recent days Inmarsat developed a second innovative technique which considers the velocity of the aircraft relative to the satellite. Depending on this relative movement, the frequency received and transmitted will differ from its normal value, in much the same way that the sound of a passing car changes as it approaches and passes by. This is called the Doppler effect. The Inmarsat technique analyses the difference between the frequency that the ground station expects to receive and that actually measured. This difference is the result of the Doppler effect and is known as the Burst Frequency Offset.\n\nThe Burst Frequency Offset changes depending on the location of the aircraft on an arc of possible positions, its direction of travel, and its speed. In order to establish confidence in its theory, Inmarsat checked its predictions using information obtained from six other B777 aircraft flying on the same day in various directions. There was good agreement.\n\nWhile on the ground at Kuala Lumpur airport, and during the early stage of the flight, MH370 transmitted several messages. At this stage the location of the aircraft and the satellite were known, so it was possible to calculate system characteristics for the aircraft, satellite, and ground station.\n\nDuring the flight the ground station logged the transmitted and received pulse frequencies at each handshake. Knowing the system characteristics and position of the satellite it was possible, considering aircraft performance, to determine where on each arc the calculated burst frequency offset fit best.\n\nThe analysis showed poor correlation with the Northern corridor, but good correlation with the Southern corridor, and depending on the ground speed of the aircraft it was then possible to estimate positions at 0011 UTC, at which the last complete handshake took place. I must emphasise that this is not the final position of the aircraft.\n\nThere is evidence of a partial handshake between the aircraft and ground station at 0019 UTC. At this time this transmission is not understood and is subject to further ongoing work.\n\nNo response was received from the aircraft at 0115 UTC, when the ground earth station sent the next log on / log off message. This indicates that the aircraft was no longer logged on to the network.\n\nTherefore, some time between 0011 UTC and 0115 UTC the aircraft was no longer able to communicate with the ground station. This is consistent with the maximum endurance of the aircraft.\n\nThis analysis by Inmarsat forms the basis for further study to attempt to determine the final position of the aircraft. Accordingly, the Malaysian investigation has set up an international working group, comprising agencies with expertise in satellite communications and aircraft performance, to take this work forward.\n\nIn Annex I (attached) there are three diagrams, showing:\n\n**Doppler correction contributions** [Image](http://i.imgur.com/ZoONTm0.png) \n\nThis diagram shows the Doppler contributions to the burst frequency offset.\n\n**MH370 measured data against predicted tracks** [Image](http://i.imgur.com/dRThs5s.png)\n\nThe blue line is the burst frequency offset measured at the ground station for MH370.\n\nThe green line is the predicted burst frequency offset for the southern route, which over the last 6 handshakes show close correlation with the measured values for MH370.\n\nThe red line is the predicted burst frequency offset for the northern route, which over the last 6 handshakes does not correlate with the measured values for MH370.\n\n**Example southern tracks** [Image](http://i.imgur.com/SwRLcOD.png)\n\nThis shows the southern tracks for a ground speed of 400 and 450 knots ground speed. It should be noted that further work is required to determine the aircraft speed and final position.\n\nSource: [MOT Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=740971779281171&id=178566888854999)",
            "Drifting away - Excellent article written by an experienced Oceanographer \n\nhttp://theconversation.com/why-locating-mh370-in-the-southern-ocean-is-so-difficult-24699\n\n\"The Southern Ocean is extremely volatile, with currents changing speed and direction from day to day, making it particularly hard to back track the drift of debris to the original impact point.\n\nOne of the unique features of the Southern Ocean is that it is the only place in the world where water can keep on moving eastward without ever hitting land. Because of this, and the strong winds, the water is swept along at very high speeds, sometimes almost 2m a second. This is much faster than any other place in the world.\n\nAt those high speeds, the current becomes unstable. It starts breaking up and forms eddies. These eddies are similar to the vortices you may see behind wakes in a river or the spiralling and treacherous winds that can form behind tall buildings in the inner city on a windy day.\"\n\nGreat visual and (almost) real time animated wind map and global ocean currents. You can zoom right in. Winds http://earth.nullschool.net/ and Currents http://earth.nullschool.net/#current/ocean/surface/currents/orthographic\n\nSo if I'm reading this correctly any debris field could be moving around in a circular pattern (eddies) or if the debris field is scattered some remains could be moving North in the Indian Ocean off Perth while other remains could be heading further South into the Southern Ocean and some bits might even end up washing ashore in New Zealand in a years time. \n",

Navigation is accomplished by using algorithms incorporating the amount of cable in the water, the depth indication from the pressure sensor and other parameters. The generator provides electrical power for the system or power from the support platform can be used if it is compatible. The tow fish carries a passive listening device for detecting pingers that automatically transmit an acoustic pulse. Most pingers transmit every second at 37.5 kHz, although the TPL can detect any pinger transmitting between 3.5 kHz and 50 kHz at any repetition rate. Commercial aircraft pingers are mounted directly on the flight recorder, the recovery of which is critical to an accident investigation. The Pinger Locator is towed behind a vessel at slow speeds, generally from 1 - 5 knots depending on the depth. The received acoustic signal of the pinger is transmitted up the cable and is presented audibly, and can be output to either a Oscilloscope, or Signal Processing Computer. The operator monitors the greatest signal strength and records the navigation coordinates. This procedure is repeated on multiple track lines until the final position is triangulated. The current TPL-25 replaces all previous systems; TPL-20, 30, & 40.\n \nBackground\nGENERAL SPECIFICATIONS Tow Body Length - 30 inches Diameter - 35 inches Weight - 70 lbs Performance Depth - 20,000 feet of seawater Speed - 1-5 knots\n \nPoint Of Contact\nNaval Sea Systems Command\nOffice of Corporate Communications (SEA 00D)\nWashington, D.C. 20376\n \nLast Update: 22 November 2013",

His passport # actually belongs to a man from Fujian with the surname Yu. You can see Mr. Yu holding his passport up for the media [here]( http://www.mnw.cn/news/china/731608.html) or [here](http://live.china.org.cn/2014/03/09/kl-beijing-flight-missing-rescue-underway/).\n\n\n- **Passengers #31 & #79:** [have the same passport #](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/20m5oc/comprehensive_timeline_malaysia_airlines_flight/cg4wdxx) [Picture of manifest here](http://www.sharelor.net/uploads/2/6/5/1/26515655/5783729_orig.png) (courtesy of /u/meowingly) \n\n\n- **Russian passenger and the stolen passport:** Early Russian media reports indicated he may not have boarded the plane due to a stolen passport issue. [One such report is available here](http://www.echomsk.spb.ru/news/kriminal/rossiyanin-propavshiy-samolet.html). From google translate: *\"As it turned out, for the flight really was registered citizen of Russia, but he could not get on board the aircraft because he stole a passport.\"* Plus, Russia has [yet to complete their passenger background checks](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/03/19/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-relatives/6597201/).\n\n\n- **The Uighur \"passenger of interest\":** this was originally thought to be the PhD artist and professor who, it turns out, [was not actually on MH370](http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/uighur-professor-i-was-not-the-one-on-mh370). Dr. Mamatjan Yasin (Yashend Maimaitijiang) was **not** on flight MH370. As the article explains, *\"Sharing the same name as the Uighur passenger on the still-missing flight, the scholar said his name has been confused by the media with that of the other man.\"*  \n[It was previously stated](http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/us-investigators-suspect-mh370-flew-on-for-four-extra-hours-after-falling-o), *\"Malaysian police and Interpol are combing through the personal backgrounds of passengers and crew of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, and have confirmed they are taking a close look at a 35-year-old passenger of Uighur descent... An unnamed source had told the daily that Malaysian police and Interpol are focusing their attention on this man because of the skills he possessed.\"* It is unclear who exactly this man was.\n\n\nNone of these issues appear to have been resolved. For example, I can't find any follow-up details clarifying who exactly the person on flight MH370 with Mr. Yu's passport # was or why he was allowed to board. Was this a fake passport situation, like the young Iranian passengers? Something more? Something less?\n\n\nI know how much reddit loves a challenge, so if you have some time or curiosity, **I'd love your help** sorting this out. I've been poring over these situations for days to no avail. If you know anything about these issues, please help point us towards sources with your response. Facts are always preferable to conjecture, which is why I tried to include credible source links for every instance.\n\n\nHopefully this post will help stir some new thoughts or ideas where I have fallen short. There are many articles on the Iranian passengers, for example, but I literally cant find anything similar concerning these 5 passengers. Any helpful thoughts, details or suggestions are very welcome at this point.  \n**edit:** Thank you to anyone willing to help!\n\n\n**edit 2:** 20 hours in, it is surprising that all we can find is 1 story possibly concerning the Uighur \"passenger of interest\". Nothing concerning the man traveling under Mr. Yu's passport #, etc. Apparently the government \"leaked\" these stories, yet is failing to follow-up as they did with the two young Iranian travelers. *These passengers, their families and their loved ones deserve to have their names cleared or their situations clarified for better or worse.* 2 weeks after MH370 disappeared over the Indian Ocean with 239 people on board, it seems bizarre that no one has reported any additional details or asked further questions concerning these situations.\n\n\n**Thank you** *to everyone who helped look for additional details and those who continue looking.* Hopefully the media / government / someone will soon follow-up and address the dearth of details concerning such truly odd circumstances, just as they previously did in the cases of Pouria Nourmohammadi and Seyed Mohammed Reza Delavar.

We apparently haven't heard a peep from the ELTs installed on MH370, which are designed to activate upon impact. \n\nHaving read this [research article](https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/2012/ar-2012-128.aspx) about ELTs and the manner in which they can fail - we as the public need to convince aviation authorities that the current emergency systems they have in place are simply not good enough when lives are at stake. \n\nWe can provide wifi on airplanes via satellite connection - I know that some of these planes run off legacy systems - but it should not be that hard to transmit GPS coordinates, identifier and bearing every minute or so to provide a record of the airplane's position to ground control, negligible strain on bandwidth. \n\nMind boggingly simple, yet mystifyingly overlooked by Malaysian Airlines - I am missing something here?  ",
            "Here is an explanation of why the Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) on Malaysia Airlines may not have gone off (they are supposed to transmit on impact) even though the aircraft presumably had 2 of these. Or more precisely - they may have gone off and no one listened.\n\n\nELTs are of 4 types:\n\n1) Automatic fixed ELT - automatically activated; permanently attached to an aircraft.\n\n2) Automatic portable ELT - automatically activated;  rigidly attached to an aircraft but readily removable from the aircraft.\n\n3) Automatic deployable ELT - rigidly attached to an aircraft; automatically deployed and activated by impact, and, in some cases, also by hydrostatic sensors. Manual deployment capability is also provided.\n\n4) Survival ELT - removable from an aircraft; stowed so as to facilitate its ready use in an emergency; manually activated by survivors.\n\n\nThese ELTs are emergency transmitters that are carried aboard most aircraft in the U.S. In the event of an aircraft accident, these devices are designed to transmit a distress signal on 121.5, 243.0-megahertz frequencies (and for newer ELTs, on 406 MHz)\n\n\nAs of February 1, 2009, the international COSPAS-SARSAT satellite system discontinued the satellite-based monitoring of the 121.5/243-MHz frequencies, in part because of a high number of false signals attributed with these frequencies. While there was no requirement in the United States to replace the first- and second-generation 121.5-MHz ELTs, after this date, 121.5/243-MHz distress signals transmitted from ELTs operating on the lower frequency would only be detected by ground-based receivers such as local airport facilities and air traffic control facilities or by overflying aircraft.\n\n\nIt is important to note that after 2009, existing 121.5-MHz ELTs, although still legal from the FAA's perspective, would have provide extremely limited assistance if an aircraft crashes, especially in a remote location.\n\n\nI don't know the specifics of the ELTs on MH 370 & the above information is for US-based airplanes covered by the FAA...but I am guessing the aircraft transmitted on the older frequency\n\n\n\nEDIT: Update...here is some more info http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/406vs121.pdf\n\n\nEDIT2: Corrections pointed out by user reddit061113",

It was triggered by reports of cracking in the fuselage skin underneath a Boeing aircraft's satellite antennae.\nIn its directive the FAA, which is responsible for supervising the safety of American-made aircraft such as Boeing, told airlines to look out for corrosion under the fuselage skin.\nThis, the FAA said, could lead to a situation where the fuselage was compromised leading to possible rapid decompression as well as the plane breaking up.\"\n\nI think that this explains both the loss of communication as well as the reason why the plane kept flying.  The plane didn't break up, it kept flying after rapid decompression and crashed into the Indian Ocean.  It is there because the pilot tried to turn around and make an emergency landing after losing communication. Due to the rapid decompression.   Must have passed out in the process trying to equalize...\n\nEdit: I'm not deleting this post so keep downvoting assholes.\n\nEdit 2: However, a spokesman for the FAA, Allen Kenitzer, told Fairfax Media that MH370 was covered by the directive.\nAdvertisement\n''The FAA does not recognise the 777-200ER as a separate model, since it is not listed on the Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS). Any Airworthiness Directive (AD) that includes the 777-200 will also include the '-200ER,' unless the effectivity is limited by airplane line number or some other factor.\u2019\u2019\n\n\nRead more: http://www.smh.com.au/world/us-warnings-on-boeing-safety-applied-to-missing-malaysia-airlines-plane-20140313-hvi0y.html#ixzz2wywEYuWL",

But we haven't been told what leads to those predicted paths shown the the Excel graph. The explanation itself is hand waving. \n\n\"Doppler\" doesn't cut it.  It doesn't matter whether the plane is moving to the north or south. Only the rate of closure/separation on a bee line between the satellite and the plane matters from a Doppler perspective. \n\nTwo planes start from the equator, one heads due north the other due south at exactly the same speed and altitude. The red shift of each plane, from the point of view of a satellite above the equator is the exactly same. \n\nNow maybe a north bound plane **has** to maneuver differently due to terrain features and **that** figures into the predicted Doppler profile. But no one has mentioned anything like that at all.\n\nI am **guessing** they are just taking averages of Doppler shifts for three other planes on northern routes that day and three other planes on southern routes that day and decided these were 'typical'. But that is an assumption. There has got to be an assumption in there to make this work. Pure Doppler is not enough. \n\nI really don't feel like we've been given an adequate explanation of this model.\n\n",

            "For those who can't access Facebook for some reason:\n> INFORMATION PROVIDED TO MH370 INVESTIGATION BY UK AIR ACCIDENTS INVESTIGATION BRANCH (AAIB)\n> \n> 25/03/14\n> \n> On 13 March we received information from UK satellite company Inmarsat indicating that routine automatic communications between one of its satellites and the aircraft could be used to determine several possible flight paths.\n> \n> Inmarsat UK has continued to refine this analysis and yesterday the AAIB presented its most recent findings, which indicate that the aircraft flew along the southern corridor.\n> \n> As you have heard, an aircraft is able to communicate with ground stations via satellite.\n> \n> If the ground station has not heard from an aircraft for an hour it will transmit a 'log on / log off' message, sometimes referred to as a \u2018ping\u2019, using the aircraft\u2019s unique identifier. If the aircraft receives its unique identifier it returns a short message indicating that it is still logged on. This process has been described as a \u201chandshake\u201d and takes place automatically.\n> \n> From the ground station log it was established that after ACARS stopped sending messages, 6 complete handshakes took place.\n> \n> The position of the satellite is known, and the time that it takes the signal to be sent and received, via the satellite, to the ground station can be used to establish the range of the aircraft from the satellite. This information was used to generate arcs of possible positions from which the Northern and Southern corridors were established.\n> \n> Refined analysis from Inmarsat\n> In recent days Inmarsat developed a second innovative technique which considers the velocity of the aircraft relative to the satellite. Depending on this relative movement, the frequency received and transmitted will differ from its normal value, in much the same way that the sound of a passing car changes as it approaches and passes by. This is called the Doppler effect. The Inmarsat technique analyses the difference between the frequency that the ground station expects to receive and that actually measured. This difference is the result of the Doppler effect and is known as the Burst Frequency Offset.\n> \n> The Burst Frequency Offset changes depending on the location of the aircraft on an arc of possible positions, its direction of travel, and its speed. In order to establish confidence in its theory, Inmarsat checked its predictions using information obtained from six other B777 aircraft flying on the same day in various directions. There was good agreement.\n> \n> While on the ground at Kuala Lumpur airport, and during the early stage of the flight, MH370 transmitted several messages. At this stage the location of the aircraft and the satellite were known, so it was possible to calculate system characteristics for the aircraft, satellite, and ground station.\n> \n> During the flight the ground station logged the transmitted and received pulse frequencies at each handshake. Knowing the system characteristics and position of the satellite it was possible, considering aircraft performance, to determine where on each arc the calculated burst frequency offset fit best.\n> \n> The analysis showed poor correlation with the Northern corridor, but good correlation with the Southern corridor, and depending on the ground speed of the aircraft it was then possible to estimate positions at 0011 UTC, at which the last complete handshake took place. I must emphasise that this is not the final position of the aircraft.\n> \n> There is evidence of a partial handshake between the aircraft and ground station at 0019 UTC. At this time this transmission is not understood and is subject to further ongoing work.\n> \n> No response was received from the aircraft at 0115 UTC, when the ground earth station sent the next log on / log off message. This indicates that the aircraft was no longer logged on to the network.\n> \n> Therefore, some time between 0011 UTC and 0115 UTC the aircraft was no longer able to communicate with the ground station. This is consistent with the maximum endurance of the aircraft.\n> \n> This analysis by Inmarsat forms the basis for further study to attempt to determine the final position of the aircraft. Accordingly, the Malaysian investigation has set up an international working group, comprising agencies with expertise in satellite communications and aircraft performance, to take this work forward.\n> \n> In Annex I (attached) there are three diagrams, showing:\n> \n> Doppler correction contributions\n> \n> This diagram shows the Doppler contributions to the burst frequency offset.\n> \n> \n> MH370 measured data against predicted tracks\n> \n> The blue line is the burst frequency offset measured at the ground station for MH370.\n> \n> The green line is the predicted burst frequency offset for the southern route, which over the last 6 handshakes show close correlation with the measured values for MH370.\n> \n> The red line is the predicted burst frequency offset for the northern route, which over the last 6 handshakes does not correlate with the measured values for MH370.\n> \n> \n> Example southern tracks\n> \n> This shows the southern tracks for a ground speed of 400 and 450 knots ground speed. It should be noted that further work is required to determine the aircraft speed and final position.\n> \n> [img1](http://i.imgur.com/AfqOXVu.png?1) [img2](http://i.imgur.com/8tMgXM1) [img3](http://i.imgur.com/rXlBWF3)",

Yes I know, it is supposed to be as naked in the air as the Sahara a 100 years ago, but that is just more BS and perception bending.\n\n\n\n\nAlso many  alleged official reports have it  'turning **around**' which takes on a whole other meaning if the craft had almost finished the  turn to M765. ( The craft would be heading  with a greater East component or if you prefer with more of an easterly direction in terms of  heading and position.) With that starting position and heading  the rest of the bits and pieces we have make more sense generically as well as specifically. As but one example with regard to \"turn back\" and  LKG. To start, just draw the line and then allow the need to wiggle around a bit due to low altitude routes, terrain, possible  A/C difficulties and a few other things possible.  ) \n\n\nAnd that works with  regard to every single possible alternative airport whether desirable or not.\n\nKeep in mind, we have also been told they  pushed back or departed ( again all vague ) approximately six minutes late.....\n\nAlso that Flighttrader24 had them well to the left of R208 as they went along it and then rounding right to basically go right over AGARI ( As expected by some but.... perhaps not by all.)\n\nSo the possible thought would be a little bit extra..... to the **left** of R208 ( and not to the right but also with a right turn ahead ) and a little late might have messed up some one else and their intentions.\n\nOne way or another.\n\n",

A force of somewhere around 4gs will activate the beacon, depending on the model. As you stated, 121.5 and 243Mhz frequencies, known as \"guard\" in the aviation community, is still widely used worldwide. These frequencies are used to transmit emergency and distress radio traffic. The fact that SARSAT is only monitoring 406MHz is a moot point in this situation, because the satellite cannot detect the signal once it is submerged in deep water. If the ELTs on MH370 are in fact working, it will require underwater listening devices in a relatively close proximity to detect it.   ",

So while the doppler would be the same from either northern or southern routes to a satellite at the nominal location (64E). The doppler will be different (very subtly) when BOTH the satellite and target are moving, this appears to be the insight that allowed them to make their determination.\n\nIf the satellite is in its south-bound phase and the plane is also on a southerly heading then the relative speed between them will be less less than if the satellite is south-bound and the aircraft is north-bound. The relative speed between the transmitter and receiver is what causes the doppler shift.",

They auto alert on impact with salt water (and if you crash land on the ground they tell you to pee on it to activate it.)  This is not the black box with the underwater pinger that is a totally different thing that is using sound in a specific frequency not found in the ocean to be discovered, it's not sending out a signal to a satellite.  While the ELTs can be destroyed in a crash and not go off they are pretty tough and you'd think in a landing where the plane runs out of fuel and doesn't fly straight into the ocean that at least one of the ELTs would go off (I mean that's what they are designed to do.)

Associated agencies will not give statements of confirmation or denial and revert to saying only that they 'worked with Inmarsat.'  The statement that they based their findings on analysis of other 777's that have flown both the northern AND the southern arcs is ludicrous.  The arc leading north is not a typical commercial routing path, let alone for large passenger jets, and the southern arc leads into nothing, meaning that there simply can't have been any other 777 ever to follow that route.  Why would a 777 EVER go that route?  A joyride from Perth?  The doppler shift explanation doesn't, at first glance, make much sense, either.  The satellite was essentially stationary relative to the aircraft.  The two paths were arcs relative to the satellite.  They both curve the same way and terminate in the same direction.  They patched this whole theory together, had it reviewed and confirmed by multiple third-parties, and closed the entire case in under a week using an entirely unproven methodology and only their in-house engineers?

            "Just how BIG & VAST is the current search area in the Southern Corridor of the Western Australian Coast? \n\nIt has been often quoted in the Media that the mammoth task of finding any trace of MH370 is like \u201ctrying to find a needle in a haystack\u201d. This is probably not the best analogy to describe just how vast and complicated the current search effort is so I will try to explain this in layman\u2019s terms using the analogy of an Olympic Size Swimming Pool which most people can relate to.  My apologies to any US readers for the use of metric measurements, being an Aussie, I can\u2019t relate to your Imperial system! I do not profess to be an expert at Maths either so any measurements and scales quoted below are simply approximations but should give you a general idea of the monumental task at hand! Anyway here goes I\u2019ll give it a crack:-\n\nThe most recent reports have \u2018narrowed down\u2019 the search area in the Southern Corridor approximately 3,500 South West from Perth to an area of approximately 600,000 square kilometers, this area is slightly larger than the size of Spain. \n\nAn Olympic Size Swimming Pool measures 25 x 50 meters or 1,250 sqm which is 12,500,000 square centimeters. The \u2018narrowed\u2019 search area is roughly 600,000 square kilometers and 1 square kilometer of this search area is equal to 20 square centimeters of the Pool or roughly a square of 4.5 x 4.5 centimeters in size which is about the diameter of a Golf Ball. \n\nNow to locate a piece of debris the size of 25 meters x 13 meters would be like trying to find the broken tip of a toothpick and to locate a wooden crate which measures 1.1 x 1.1 meters would be like trying to find a pinhead in an Olympic Size Pool. \n\nIf you can imagine that search aircraft looking in the narrowed search area would be roughly equivalent to miniature mosquito's moving across the Pool less than 1 centimeter above the surface of the water and \u2018spotters\u2019 from this mosquito size aircraft can view a field area roughly 20 centimeters in all directions and are looking for a piece of debris the size of a broken toothpick tip \u2018bobbing up and down\u2019 in this field area which would be even smaller when viewed from above. These aircraft have less than 2-3 hours on a single mission to scout each potential area.\n\nShips scouting the area would be like miniature Lego man with an even smaller range of vision of than aircraft passing over. This search area which is known as the Roaring 40\u2019s has some of roughest seas in the world with strong currents, strong Westerly winds and it is common to waves over 20 feet plus in height during bad weather. Strong currents, constant wave motion, sea foam, flotsam and jetsam would make the task even more difficult!! \n\nNow imagine the satellites that are passing over this area of 600,000 square kilometers, they would need to be over the right spot at the right time with clear visibility and no cloud cover to capture any object that may be bobbing up and down in the ocean. To scan and capture an area this size a Satellite would need to process roughly 30,000 images each with an area of 20 square kilometers in size so this might explain why the resolution is so low and time it takes to process. \n\nI am not sure what maximum resolutions are available but I read somewhere that the Chinese Gaofen 1 High Resolution Satellite can identify objects 1-2 meters in size. A single image which is roughly 20 square kilometers in size using the example above equals 20,000,000 square meters so that requires a massive amount of time and magnification to check and process a single image even with automated state of the art processing systems in place. \n\nSpare a thought for the search teams as this is an incredibly difficult and mammoth operation!!!\n",

            "Full text of Malaysian press conference\n\nIntroductory statement \n\n\nThe search for MH370 continues. Over the past few days, new leads from satellite data have focused \nour search and rescue operations in the southern corridor. Our partners continue to deploy assets to \nassist us, as we work to narrow the search areas. \n\n\n\\1. Operational update \n\n\nYesterday, 18,500 square nautical miles were searched in the Australian search area.   \nTwo orange objects approximately one metre in length and one white coloured drum were sighted \nby search aircraft, but remain unidentified and have not been conclusively linked to MH370.   \nHMAS Success detected two radar targets within the search area, but could not locate the targets on \nfurther investigation of the area.   \nEarlier today, a Chinese search plane reportedly sighted objects in the Australian search area. These \nobjects are not in the vicinity of those which were identified by the Australian authorities last week.   \nA few minutes ago the Prime Minister received a call from the Prime Minister of Australia, who \ninformed him that an Australian search aircraft had located two objects in the Australian search \narea, one circular and one rectangular.   \nHMAS Success is in the vicinity and it is possible that the objects could be received within the next \nfew hours, or by tomorrow morning at the latest.   \nThree search areas, totalling approximately 20,000 square nautical miles, have been identified for \noperations today. RCC Australia anticipates that 10 aircraft will be used.   \nHMAS Success remains the only vessel in the search area. A number of Chinese vessels are expected \nto commence arriving within the search area on 25th March.   \n3 aircraft - 2 from Japan and 1 from the UAE \u2013 have already departed from Subang today and are en \nroute to the southern corridor.   \n6 Malaysian ships, with 3 ship-borne helicopters, are now in northern part of the southern corridor.   \n10 Chinese ships are in the southern corridor, carrying out search and rescue operations. HMS Echo \nis currently refuelling in the Maldives and will be sailing to the southern corridor this evening.   \nIn the northern corridor, Turkmenistan have confirmed they have not had any sightings of MH370 on \ntheir radar. Each piece of information we receive from our partners in the northern corridor helps us \nto continuously narrow the corridor. \n\n\\2. Satellite images \n\n\nNew leads into MH370\u2019s possible location have come from satellite data. This was one of the four \ntools we identified that could narrow the search area, along with surveillance radar data, increasing \nsurface and air assets, and bringing in more technical experts.   \nThe most recent images were obtained by French satellites, which captured radar images of \npotential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor on 21st\n March.  \nThese images were received by Malaysia on the evening of the 22nd March, and were relayed to RCC Australia on the morning of the 23rd March, as they are leading the search in that particular area of the southern corridor.   \nThis morning we have received a further set of images from French satellites, this time captured by \ncameras. These images were taken yesterday and have been relayed to RCC Australia.   \n\n\\3. Family briefings \n\nYesterday, the high-level team met with families in Beijing for more than eight hours. \nThe families asked many questions, and made detailed requests for radar readings and other data.   \nSome of these questions could not be answered, and some of the data they requested was still being \nheld by the investigation, as is standard procedure in investigations of this sort.   \nAfter meeting with the families for a total of more than twelve hours, and taking hundreds of \nquestions, the high-level team has returned to Kuala Lumpur to discuss the matters raised at the \nmeetings. They will return to Beijing tomorrow to continue.   \nThe briefings in Kuala Lumpur over the last two days went smoothly, and the families responded as \npositively as could be expected, with the families engaging with representatives from the relevant \nauthorities.   \nIt has always been our intention to keep the families as fully informed as possible. We continue to \ndo so.   \n\n\\4. Specific questions \n\nThere are a few specific questions I would like to respond to.   \nOn the police investigation, we can confirm that the police have interviewed more than a hundred \npeople, including families of both the pilot and co-pilot.   \nAs far as the transcript is concerned, the technical committee is considering releasing it and we will \nkeep you informed about the decision.   \nThe Inspector General of the Police will attend tomorrow\u2019s press conference to answer further \nquestions on the investigation.   \nWe can also confirm that MH370 was carrying wooden pallets. However, there is as yet no evidence \nthat these are related to the wooden pallets reportedly sighted in the Australian search area. \n\n\\5. Concluding remarks \n\nThe search for MH370 has taken us halfway around the world. At the moment there are new leads, \nbut nothing conclusive. Our thoughts continue to be with the families who are still waiting for news.   \nIn the meantime, we are grateful for the on-going co-operation shown by our partners in this \nmultinational search. \n",

We know that ocean is not in the path of, or even very near, any shipping lanes.  I can't imagine a common fishing boat would wander THAT far out -- whatever fish are out there, we don't need them that badly....  And, we can assume the aliens would still be at a minimum several light years away.  Thus, the wooden pallet would presumably have had to have traveled thousands of miles for a very long time to get to where they found it.\n\nNow, as you may or may not be aware, wooden pallets are, in fact, constructed of.... wood. I just don't think a wooden pallet would stay in one piece for that long, being exposed to ocean water, and sun, and cold.  This is based on my supreme expertise in the studies of wooden pallets in oceans.\n\nI then employ my vast and non-existent knowledge of how to pack cargo onto a plane.  The mangosteens were on that pallet.  They just HAD to be.  If not, the Universe will implode.  How could it miss such a beautiful coincidence??

Ships en route.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26714628)\n\n[The Guardian has more information](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/mh370-chinese-plane-spots-white-objects-live-updates) - green and orange objects.\n\nFurther update:\n\n\"Australia's prime minister has confirmed that the ship HMAS is trying to recover the two new objects spotted\nby search plane.\n\nIn a statement to Parliament Tony Abbott, cautioned that the objects may turn out to be unrelated to the missing Malaysian Airlines plane. He said:\n\n    The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has advised that objects have been located by a Royal Australian Air Force P3 Orion and I can advise the House that HMAS Success is on scene and is attempting to locate and recover these objects.\n\n    The objects were spotted in the search area about 2500 kilometres southwest of Perth at about 2.45pm our time.\n\n    The crew on board the Orion reported seeing two objects, the first a grey or green circular object and the second an orange rectangular object. These are separate to the objects reported earlier today by a Chinese search aircraft.\n\n    I can advise the House that US Navy Poseidon, a second Royal Australian Air Force Orion and a Japanese Orion are also on route to or in the search area. Planes and ships continue to search the area for any sign of the missing aircraft.\n\n    I caution again, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that we don\u2019t know whether any of these objects are from MH370. They could be flotsam. Nevertheless we are hopeful that we can recover these objects soon and that they will take us a step closer to resolving this tragic mystery.\n\n    This is an extraordinary mystery. An absolutely baffling mystery. But as I\u2019ve said before, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, let me reiterate to this House we owe it to the families of those on board, we owe it to the loved ones on board, we owe it to all the people who are concerned about the fate of this aircraft to do whatever we reasonably can to find anything that is out there, to test it and to see what we can learn about what so far is one of the great mysteries of our time.\"",

With all the misinformation, changed information and pure lack of information emanating from this investigation, perhaps investigations of this size and nature should set up a small \"Public Information Release\" team. The remit of the team would simply be to review the information currently known to the investigation team and decide what can be released to the general public. The team's guiding principal would be \"Would the release of this information truly hamper the investigation?\" and would be weighed up against the positive aspect that the public could actually aid the investigation by providing more information and analysis to it as a result of the increased information flow.\n\nIt appears to me that in the MH370 case there is no dedicated team looking at this issue and thus the authorities, with no good guidance and lacking a rigorous approach to the costs/benefits of releasing information, are instead resorting to a default stance of \"Let's not release any meaningful information unless there have been any leaks or potentially difficult major media conjecture\".\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts?",

The crew and passengers then lost consciousness due to smoke filling the plane and the auto-pilot continued flying the plane until it ran out of fuel.\n\nThis was one of the theories suggested on PPRUNE http://www.pprune.org/rumours-news/535538-malaysian-airlines-mh370-contact-lost-372.html",

If I am to believe Google Maps, the shortest distance between these is 2000 miles. To traverse this (unlikely) distance in 2.93 hours would require an average speed of 680 mph, far greater than the official max speed of 590 mph for the 777.

What he found was that the interim arcs he produced in this way were able to distinctly define the final location in reverse.

The plane only had 7-8 hours of fuel, and that's calculated on a FL350 cruise. We know from the pings that it was airborne for 7 hours. We also know that planes consume more fuel at lower altitudes. The plane would have consumed a hell of a lot more fuel had it stayed at 12,000ft, and it also would have had a much lower TAS (true airspeed).

For example, RADAR being too sensitive and gathering too many false hits or too much info to sort through in a timely manner?\n* Can the fancy ass technology be scaled back or calibrated for different circumstances?\n* From what I understand, a military ship big enough to refuel the current search planes would be vulnerable and would require an escort of military ships. This, combined with the brutal ocean waters of the area, eliminate the possibility of refueling in this manner. Am I correct?\n* If so, are there civilian ships capable of refueling and would not need a military escort?\n* If the fancy ass technology is moot and the only realistic way to refuel is by land, are there other aircraft available that are able to carry more fuel and more scouts while flying low enough to search?\n* Is/Are there military aircraft that are less tech savvy, carry the same number of scouts currently being used and a whole lot more fuel?\n\nIt kinda seems like we wanted to use our Big Boy Toys rather than utilize what would work best for the job.

Ditching a widebody bird on water, without severely damaging it, is incredibly difficult even in calm waters. If miraculously they got it on the water in one piece, then it depends on how long it can float. Airplanes like this do have a \"ditching mode\" button on the overhead panel, which seals various vents and helps keep water out of the cabin (fun fact: Capt. Sullenburger didn't have time to press this button, which is why US1493 sank so quickly). Even in \"ditching mode\", I\"m really not sure how long it would float, given that they'd probably open the doors in order to deploy the life rafts. On top of that, it comes to the issue of power. Obviously the engines would be shut down, which would leave the APU. The exhaust for the APU is in the tail, and would probably be submerged, greatly hindering its ability to function. Without the APU, that'd only leave the emergency battery, which I believe only lasts a few hours.

Why go to the lengths and difficulty of disabling ACARS, etc. as opposed to simply nosediving? Regardless, that is not an act of impulse but an act of foresight and planning.\n\n\nPoint being: we hardly know anything for certain at this point.

Its grabbed from volunteers around the world with ADS-B radios that pick up the 1GHz radio transmissions from the planes, but data glitches do occur, and its not uncommon to see a plane go from 35000 feet to 0 feet, and then back to 35000 feet.  The data of course, is wrong.\n\n- Because the data is not perfect, nor reliable in reception, flightradar attempts to make it easier on the viewer by smoothing out such data so it gives the appearance of the plane moving steadily along its path.\n\n- Because the data is not perfect in reception, flightradar attempts to make it easier for the viewer by extrapolating the plane's last known position and velocity for a while (30 seconds or so) if no signals are received... in the hope that soon more data will be received.\n\n- But if new signals are then received, the plane's position is updated.  Normally, the plane will have continued on its course, so the new data will fit nicely with the previous extrapolated position.  But not always.  If the plane did change course, or the last data was glitchy, its quite common to see a plane move VERY rapidly in an unusual way to a new location.  I've seen planes cross entire oceans in the matter of mere seconds because of false data.\n\n- The stuff you see on screen is NOT the raw data that flightradar use.

If it was part of a hijacking, everyone involved has been very quiet, whether it succeeded or failed. You'd think human intelligence (spies) would have got a hint of something if it had been part of a hijacking operation.\n\nThe most fitting scenario I can see, if it went north and shadowed another plane, was that the hijackers were alone or nearly alone and planned to land somewhere and then announce their coup to the world. They didn't have anyone waiting for them, they just wanted to fly to Turkmenistan or Western China and land at a busy airport and have a hostage situation, but instead something went wrong and the plane crashed en-route.\n\nOn the other hand it would be much easier to just take the plane on the ground, rather than waiting for it to be airborne and take it mid-flight.",

The missing aircraft would immediately be noticed, and their plan would already be in jeopardy as governments begin searching for it. Also, transponders for the missing plane would be recognized by air traffic control towers if they tried to fly it into Israel or some other place under the guise of a normal airplane. \n\nIt's FAR easier to simply hijack a cargo plane, or even buy your own plane of equal size. Airline planes get decommissioned and dumped all the time. It would be 1000 times better to just do it that way. \n\nNothing about hijacking a fully loaded passenger plane to land it in Afghanistan or elsewhere to use as as a weapon is intelligent, even less doable.",

For instance, finding a life preserver unit only used in aircraft would be a giant find - it would indicate that at the very least, an aircraft's life preserver is there. Radar won't find these small non-metallic things, so it can at best augment a search - but a visual (when weather and visibility permits) search could find a lot of things.\n\n>* Is the fancy ass technology too much? For example, RADAR being too sensitive and gathering too many false hits or too much info to sort through in a timely manner?\n\nIt can be. As I stated, a visual search can find a lot of things radar can't - also, with the weather/waves in the area, radar can be producing a lot of false hits\n\n> *Can the fancy ass technology be scaled back or calibrated for different circumstances?\n\nSure - but you can only put so many crewmembers on board a plane so when they search visually, they can literally have aircrew looking out windows instead of manning their radar stations\n\n>* From what I understand, a military ship big enough to refuel the current search planes would be vulnerable and would require an escort of military ships. This, combined with the brutal ocean waters of the area, eliminate the possibility of refueling in this manner. Am I correct?\n\nYes and no - this area doesn't have risk to those ships. However, to refuel planes, those ships have to be aircraft carriers - and you can't land the C-130s and P-3s and P-8s that are being used for searching (they are large planes, think like an airliner size)\n\n>* If the fancy ass technology is moot and the only realistic way to refuel is by land, are there other aircraft available that are able to carry more fuel and more scouts while flying low enough to search?\n\nThe best aircraft for these missions are already in use - the P-3 and P-8 are designed for these kinds of missions. What's left is sending more aircraft and coordinating the planning so that all daylight hours can be covered without risking mid-air collisions over the water due to having too many planes in the area\n\n>* Is/Are there military aircraft that are less tech savvy, carry the same number of scouts currently being used and a whole lot more fuel?\n\nThe biggest issue is that this area is so remote that you need large aircraft capable of carrying a ton of fuel to even reach it. Thus, it eliminates most military aircraft - leaving only these long range patrol planes to do the searching.\n\n",

So what?  Its not a large enough sample size to be statistically relevant.  people commit suicide in all sorts of ways.  some shoot themselves.  some shoot others and then themselves.  some slit their wrists.  some sit in their car and then wait for the carbon monoxide to put them to sleep, only to be found days or weeks later (sound familiar?).

            "Military radar even ;-)",
            "It's certainly not outside the possible, but you can't just ignore what I just wrote about the cabin crew. They are trained to deal with cabin depressurization (and have better oxygen equipment that the passengers). However, if MH370 really did climb to FL450 (this data is tweaked from primary radar azimuth values and not particularly reliable) that would add weight to a suicide theory. At FL450 anyone without a pressure fed mask will pass out almost immediately (it only takes a few seconds to dump the cabin pressure). Anyway, in the end I have more faith in humans than machinery (I have seen enough of it fail). The only way I would consider suicide more likely than a system breakdown if is the latter is rules out completely - which it's certainly not yet.",
            "I believe that too (although from a different cause). However, the crew are trained to deal with depressurization scenarios. They would contact the flight deck and (unless a rogue pilot manage to convince them differently) would eventually force their way into the cockpit.\n\nIn a real accident, lets say a cabin blowout (explosion or fire) they would be very busy with their emergency procedures while the pilot (expectedly) descended to safe altitude. Flight deck emergencies have 3 priorities: aviate, navigate, communicate. A progressive systems failure (be that from fire, short circuit, or explosion - or a combination) could disable both communication and control systems before the pilot knew what hit him. Leaving the AC cold and dark without cabin pressure.\n\nI remember a story many years back, where an engine fire on a four engine plane caused AC to ditch. Almost a year earlier a mechanic had replaced certain fuses with the wrong type, and when the pilot pulled the T-handle (to stop and feather the burning engine) it went pop-pop-pop as current ran across the system and stopped the 3 healthy engines. This should have been a perfectly normal minor incident. Instead the plane had to ditch in the sea. Luckily everyone survived.",
            "Sorry, but you are not really. You can take facts (few in this case) and build a theory around them, or you can take a theory and make the facts fit. There are two ways. I don't know which is wrong, but it's not mine :-)\n\nThe base fact is that the transponder on MH370 stopped at 01:21 and the ACARS stopped sometime between 01:07 and 01:37. The plane deviated from its planned flight path and the last primary radar contact by Malaysian military was 200 miles NW of Penang (02:15). The flight path between 01:21 and 02:15 is not fully determined. ",

It wasn't until 4/5 days ago, after the Prime Minister's Press Conference, when this incident was officially declared a criminal investigation, that Malaysia Airlines announced they would no longer be in charge of disseminating information to the families. Since then, it's been the Malaysian government's responsibility to inform the families and since then they have grown increasingly unhappy with what they've received. Clearly the government is not being as attentive or forthcoming as the airline was. ",

As I stated at yesterday's press conference, this is now a truly international effort. Our focus remains: the rescue and search operation. We are working on narrowing the search corridor by firstly gathering satellite information, secondly analysing radar data, thirdly increasing air and surface assets, and fourthly increasing the number of technical experts. We are also taking further steps to address the needs of the families at this very difficult time.\n\n>I will start by giving a brief operational update, and as we have said, the search of MH370 involves diplomatic, technical, and logistical challenges. Accordingly, the main technical team organising the search and rescue operation has been broken into 3 groups. A diplomatic team led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an assets deployment and logistics team led by the armed forces, and the technical group retaining overall operation of control, which is led by the Department of Civil Aviation.\nOn the diplomatic front, all 26 countries involved in the search and rescue operations have verbally agreed to assist the operation, and Malaysia has written to all countries formally requesting cooperation. A number of assets have already been committed, and are waiting diplomatic clearance to begin operations. Once we receive formal clearance, we can then speed up the deployment of assets along the search corridors.\n\n>As I stated yesterday, although the search is still coordinated by Malaysia, our partners are increasingly taking the lead in their own territory, and in agreed search sectors. We welcome this, and again would like to thank all our partners for their continued assistance and support. I can confirm that we have received some radar data. But we are not at liberty to release information from other countries. I appeal to all our partners to continue volunteering any of and all information that could help us with the investigation and the search for MH370.\n\n>Regarding reports that the plane was sighted in the Maldives, I can confirm that the Malaysian Chief of Defense Force has contacted his counterpart in the Maldives, who has confirmed that these reports are not true.\n\n>I am aware of speculations that additional waypoints were added to the aircraft's flight routing. I can confirm that the aircraft flew on a normal routing up until the waypoint Igari. There is no additional waypoint on MH370's documented flight plan, which depicts normal routing all the way into Beijing.\nOn the police investigation, as the Inspector General of the Police confirmed, the case have been classified under Section 130C of the Penal Code. All passengers, crew, and ground staff handling the aircraft are being investigated.\n\n>We are sharing all information relevant to the case with all relevant international investigative agencies that require it. We have received passenger background checks from all countries apart from Ukraine and Russia, both of which had nationals on board. So far no information of significance on any passengers have been found.\n\n>Local and international expertise will be recruited to examined the pilot's flight simulator. Some data had been deleted from the simulator, and forensic work to retrieve this data is on-going.\nI would like to take this opportunity to state that the passengers, the pilots, and the crew remain innocent until proven otherwise. For the sake of their families, I ask that we refrain from any unnecessary speculation that might make an already difficult time even harder.\n\n>I would like to announce that in addition to the team that is already on the ground, Malaysia is currently assembling a high level team that will immediately travel to Beijing. The team will give briefings and updates to next of kin on the latest situation on the search and rescue plans. The team will include representatives from the Prime Minister's office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Royal Malaysian Air Force, the Department of Civil Aviation, and Malaysian Airlines. The team will be led by Leftenant General Dato' Seri Akbar bin Haji Abdul Samad, RMAF, Air Operation Commander of the Royal Malaysian Air Force, assisted by Ahmad Nizar bin Zolfakar, director of Air Traffic Services, Department of Civil Aviation, and will include a senior 777 pilot.\n\n>We will persevere. Our immediate focus is the search and rescue operation, and we are pursuing every means possible to narrow the two search corridors. Thank you.",

            "In regards to China:\n\nThere is a very important thing to point out right now- currently, Chinese officials are going through a very rigorous \"clamp down\" imposed by their new leadership to get rid of corruption at all levels. Local officials, all the way down to police in each city, are working extended hours, 6 days a week, and are under intense scrutiny by both the media and the leadership. *Source: its national news and my wife's father is a police chief.\n\nIf something were to happen in China (ie: they shot MH370 down) there would be a very serious reaction from the Chinese people and a general mistrust of the government, right when the new Preimer is trying to eliminate prior problems with government mistrust (while he himself is still being as secretive as ever).\n\nThe media coverage INSIDE of China (CCTV) has not been focusing on this situation much at all, particularly when compared to US media outlets. Now, this is nothing new, but the majority of the passengers were Chinese nationals, which makes you wonder why they aren't talking about it.\n\nAnother major point:\n\nChinese naval capabilities are light years behind the US. They don't want to admit this publicly by having a poor showing, so are staying back and allowing western forces to do the majority of the searching. BUT this could also be because China already knows what happened to the plane and doesn't want to put itself out there to look stupid by not being able to find the plane. While at the same time they don't mind the US publicly being shown to not be able to find it- maintaining that they know nothing about it crossing into their airspace.\n\nMeanwhile the US is spending a HUGE amount of capital on a plane that was not in their airspace, had only 3 of its citizens on board, and was not operated by any of its airlines.

Here goes nothing:\n\n\n**This thread has already located the plane, and does not realize it yet.**\n\n\n**1) This was not an accident or sudden catastrophe.** The Malaysian government [bluntly stated](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-flight.html?_r=0) on Saturday that, \u201cThese movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane\u201d.\n\n\n**2) Motive: the Uighurs (aka the East Turkestan Islamic Movement).** As has been exhaustively detailed in recent days, the Uighurs possess sufficient motive, have a proven history of escalating violence, and publicly asserted their responsibility for this tragedy shortly after it occurred.  \nWas it the pilot? The crew? Passengers? Some combination thereof? It does not necessarily make a difference who exactly was flying the plane off-course in this case, only that we know someone was intentionally flying the plane off-course.  \n\n\n**3) MH370 was heading towards Xinjiang, the heart of Uighur territory. Most likely along the China - Kyrgyzstan border.** Again, this is supported by a broad spectrum of prior evidence, ranging from the fact this region resides perfectly along the Northern corridor to the [recent news](https://twitter.com/cctvnews/status/445766657361715200) *\"China has begun searching within its territory of the northern corridor\"* and a [new report that](http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/us-military-base-south-asian-airports-in-mh370-pilots-simulator-says-paper) *\"Investigators are looking into the possibility that the plane could have landed at an airport where control might have been lax, or that it landed on sea, hills or an open space.\"* Plus, China is one of the only countries which has not yet shared their radar data. \n\n\n**4) For the first time, within the past 24 hours, both /u/shiningPate & /u/rufusisnotacat shared global fire detection data from NASA's MODIS Worldview.** In short, they found fire burning near the China-Kyrgyzstan border **\"along the final flight path\"**. These fires burned on March 8, but did not appear on March 7 or March 9. Both [rufusisnotacat's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/20m5oc/comprehensive_timeline_malaysia_airlines_flight/cg4z0zz) and [shiningPate's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/20m5oc/comprehensive_timeline_malaysia_airlines_flight/cg4wxu6) provide some interesting maps, links and visuals.\n\n\n**5)** This matters because **these aberrant fires occur against a mountainside less than 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Aksu Airport in Xinjiang.**  \nAksu Airport resides *very* near the China-Kyrgyzstan border, at an elevation of 3,835 feet (1,169 m). The area is surrounded by [one of the largest mountain ranges in the world](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1414), and the immediate vicinity around Aksu Airport is sparsely populated. Aksu Airport has a runway length of 7,874 feet (2,400 m), [sufficient landing runway length](http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/commercial/airports/acaps/7772sec3.pdf) for a Boeing 777 even at the [maximum design landing weight](http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/commercial/airports/faqs/sec3charts.pdf) of 460,000 pounds (208,700 kg), much less one running on fumes and a nearly empty gas tank.\n\n\n**TL;DR: After flying over 7 grueling hours and pulling off one of the most daring capers in modern aviation history, the person(s) in control of Malaysian Airlines flight 370 simply needed to land the plane at their final destination... and instead crashed during what was likely their first-ever approach to an airport surrounded by the mountains in the heart of friendly (Uighur) territory. This hijacking/act of terror was successful (secure the plane), but it was also a failure (land safely and then...?).**\n\n\n**An imgur gallery** showing the location of the fires in comparison to Aksu Airport, the China-Kyrgyzstan border, and the estimated last known \"ping\" position is visible here: http://imgur.com/a/pJNag \n\n\nFor those with higher bandwith, a more detailed imgur gallery via Google Earth is visible here: http://imgur.com/a/dLDEQ \n\n\nAksu Airport is only 70 miles from the last known \"ping\" location. The 4 fires are less that 50 miles from the airport, in the path of a flight's descent. The fires are clustered together within a 3 mile radius. 2 of the fires are very close, less than 1 mile apart.\n\n\nThe flight to Kuala Lumpur-Beijing is 2,700 miles.  The flight range of a Boeing 777-200 Extended Range is up to [9,935 nautical miles](http://www.boeing.com/boeing/commercial/777family/pf/pf_lrback.page). The search area now encompasses 2.24 million square miles.\n\n\nCrashing a plane 50 miles from an airport, and roughly 100 miles from the last known \"ping\", is a miniscule margin of error in comparison to the scope and scale of things.\n\n\nThe search is having trouble locating MH370. **This places MH370 just beyond the last known \"ping\", 50 miles from an airport in territory controlled by the only people claiming responsibility for this tragedy.** That's not half bad when the search grid is 2.24 million square miles and encompasses nearly 1/2 the globe.\n\n\nYou've done good, reddit.

Was any flight reprogramming also evident in any of the earlier ACARS transmissions, such as 00:37 ?\n\n-    Clarification of the various change of altitude stories, asking for times and altitudes of what is known.\n\n-    Why the Australian search area lies OUTSIDE the last ping arc.\n\nhttp://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/19/world/asia/19plane-map/19plane-map-articleLarge.png\n\n-    The transcript isn't required, but times of who in the cockpit was on the radio at what times. If it was the copilot that did the 01:19 handoff, when was the last time that we heard anything from the pilot (Captain)?\n\n-    Did the aircraft have an ELT, and if so what type? (g-force activated...etc...)\n",
            "Does anyone have information on the last couple flights for the MH 777? \n\nI'm not an expert on FMS and redundancy , but whats the possibility that an electrical fire started, prior to last communication, that caused the FMS to reset to a backup which was made on a prior flight containing the waypoints we see MH370 flying to after ATC termination. \n\n\nDoes the FMS have a buffer that holds locational data on the next waypoint till the FMC instructs it to the next one? It would explain the fact that the FMC was updated(loaded backup but did not update buffer) prior to IGARI and ATC Termination. Then this buffer would receive the next waypoint once it confirmed and reached IGARI... except now, the backup would be loaded(maybe from a prior flight) thus trying to turn towards a previous flight plan.\n\n\nI'm sure the pilots would notice the deviation to the West, but maybe, just maybe, smoke inhalation/hypoxia hit and they weren't paying attention to the compass/FMS. It'd be a long shot, but at this point, everybody's grasping straws.",
            "Copypasta from PPRuNe but I found it interesting. Only hole no can shoot in it is the \"alright, goodnight\" timing to the turn. But a well written theory none the less. \n\nRecall the Swissair 111 accident off Halifax on Sep. 2 1998?\n21 minutes after the first detection of unusual odour in the cockpit Swissair Flight 111 struck the water killing all 229 onboard.\n\nThe biggest problem on the Swissair 111 was the toxicity of the smoke generated by the burning metallized mylar (aka MPET, the ubiquitous acoustic insulation used throughout the aircraft beneath the cabin linings). SR-111's fate was sealed by the eventual checklist action by the flight crew of turning off the bus controlling the recirculation fans (which allowed the fire to be sustained and propagate forward into the flight-deck ceiling). The fire was found to have started in the forward galley area, in an area near to the ceiling-stowed fwd R1 door. The wiring short was related to a poorly installed and power-hungry IFE system. So before the plane hit the water, both pilots (one of whom had left his seat to fight the flight-deck ceiling fire), were most likely incapacitated. In any case, because of the checklist, they had no autopilot and the standby flight instruments had also been compromised.\n\nIf you consider that MH370 possibly had a fire that generated toxic smoke, then everything can be adequately explained. \n\nTheir first turn to the left, about 41 mins after take off, was with the intention to clear the airway and divert immediately towards the nearest alternate aerodrome (a standard operating procedure for depressurization was also to descend). But that (depressn) was probably not the case. The transponder stops transmitting, most likely due to damage caused by the fire/avionics bay explosion/bus disconnects. See tinyurl.com/p92wnej for their likely choice of a proximate East Coast alternate airfield large enough for a 777-200 (the 13,000-foot runway at Pulau Langkaw). On roll-out they were pointed right at it.\n\nI'm not sure whether the avionics bay would have smoke detectors - as avionics bays are always naturally emanating electrical odours that could trigger expensive false alarms. In other words, a wiring fire or arcing event may have been able to smoulder down there for quite a while - undetected.\n\nThere was a very garbled transmission heard by another aircraft (JAL), so most likely oxy masks were already in use in the cockpit.\n\nThe level of toxicity of the smoke would dictate how long the crew exposed to that toxic environment remained able to perform their duties. Could a step in the fire of unknown origin checklist (e.g. avionics bay fans) have precipitated a sudden increase in fire and smoke? If so, it may not have been as disastrous a development as it was on SR-111 - as all MPET acoustic insulation had long ago been removed from Boeing airplanes (it is assumed).\n\nThe transponder stopped in the same spot, at the turn - so if a fire is assumed, it was already uncontrolled and was taking place in the avionics compartment, because it did damage the transponder.\n\nIf the first turn was done with the Autopilot engaged to clear the airway (standard operating procedure) and a descent was not initiated until clear of the airway, a possible explanation is the flight crew was by now incapacitated The aircraft would roll out on heading and the aircraft would fly as long as the now self-extinguished fire and sustained damage would allow it - whether the autopilot's baro hold was still intact or not. (likely it was not, explaining the altitude excursions). Are the pitot-static data lines routed through the avionics bay? They must be. What could be the effect on the autopilots of a partially fire-compromised (and leaking) static pressure line? As fuel burnt off and trim changed, would the aircraft just continue to climb (assuming autopilot baro-hold was unserviceable)?\n\nAll the avionics on this aircraft are below the cockpit, so all it takes is an electrical fire that generates a high level of toxic smoke and anybody in contact with that smoke can be knocked out in a matter of minutes, even with crew oxygen masks on. For that matter, how secure is the oxy bottles and piping to the cockpit? Do they pass through the avionics compartment? Are those pipes to the pilot and copilot regulators routed alongside each other? If so (and it's likely that they are) that may have been the ultimate Achilles heel.\n\nI believe that the power Circuit Breaker for the cockpit door locking solenoid is in the avionics bay. If it pops, is that door-lock fail-safe? (i.e. does it remain locked)?\n\nEven if the fire extinguished itself eventually, the toxic smoke is the killer; so this aircraft would fly on until it ran out of fuel - assuming nobody is able to access the cockpit from the cabin..... possibly because no F/A had (or could recall) the access code or because the captain also had a dead-bolting policy for the inside of the door. 777-200 door is fitted with a dead-bolt. I've never liked that term \"dead-bolt\". It is so fatefully conclusive.",

If you know you're entering new airspace and you're unidentified, don't you want to immediately communicate with them so you're not viewed as a threat and (potentially) shot down?\n\n2.

Is it like a yearly course they take so it's fresh, or is it something you learn once and hope it never actually happens?",

When it rose to 45,000 feet it may have been an attempt by the pilot to lower the fire by reducing oxygen. The plane then went down to around 17,000 feet this may have been so the doors of the plan could be opened to try get rid of smoke being caused by the fire.\n\nPilots are told time and time again REMEMBER ALL THE AIRPORT AROUND YOU! Reason being is in case of something like an electrical fire they will know an airport to quickly divert too for help. The reason the pilot did not go back on himself was cause the terrain was unfriendly, he went west to another airport with a 13,000 feet landing strip. \n\nWhen an electrical fire happens on a plane the pilot or co pilot would try and find the fault on the board. When they found the fault they would pull the plug for that from the circuit board. If its a big issue they would have had to remove all the plugs meaning the TRANSPONDER WOULD SWITCH OFF!\n\nA few days ago I was one of the people saying its been parked somewhere and stripped down and is going to get used probably in some terrorist attack in the future.

How he is flying 777s after 2,000 hours is beyond me. Be thankful we have the FAA here. When I was in flight school, the Chinese government sent (and still does) students to our college, where they go through the typical four year aviation program, but then they go back and jump right in to the cockpit of the heavy birds. They were the only ones allowed in the bigger Sims. I'm not a professional pilot, and I only have my PPL now, so my opinion is anecdotal, but the maneuvers seem rather suspicious.

            "> the Uighurs possess sufficient motive, have a proven history of escalating violence, and publicly asserted their responsibility for this tragedy shortly after it occurred.\n\nThat's inaccurate.  First, no Uighurs publicly asserted their responsibility for the attack - the claim of responsibility is being attributed to a [difficult-to-trace, encrypted email](http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/21912148/terror-group-claims-responsibility-of-missing-malaysia-airlines-mh370/).  This email could have come from literally *anyone*.  Further, violence committed by Uighurs has generally been confined to attacks on [local police in Xinjiang](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/30/us-china-xinjiang-idUSBRE9BT02V20131230).  Successfully hijacking a plane is exponentially more sophisticated than anything the Uighurs have done heretofore (they tried it once *within China* & failed at that.  It's unbelievable to think that they could successfully hijack an international flight). \n\nAs I said [a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/20iyi7/comprehensive_timeline_malaysia_airlines_flight/cg3tjdc), I think the Chinese media are trumping up the involvement of Uighurs to discredit them due to ongoing territorial clashes in Xinjiang.  \n\nBeyond the issues with the Uighur angle, if the ultimate destination was China, I don't understand why they wouldn't have entered China on the flight path that was filed to Beijing.  That would get the plane into Chinese airspace without arousing suspicion, and the aircraft could have turned off its transponders then & headed to Xinjiang.  By turning back towards the Malacca Straits, MH370 could have had to fly over Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Burma, and/or Nepal.  Why risk crossing so many borders to fly into China covertly if the plane were already heading to China openly?  \n\nOn a note of curiosity, do you have any sources for the following claims?\n\n>  MH370 was heading towards Xinjiang, the heart of Uighur territory. Most likely along the China - Kyrgyzstan border\n\n> This places MH370 just beyond the last known \"ping\"\n\nEDIT: fixed link",

            "It's a nice theory, but you are fitting too much evidence around a pre-conceived conclusion, instead of fitting around a conclusion around the evidence\n\nNot only have no Uighur groups taken responsibility for this, you have to overcome 4 important issues:\n\n* Uighur territory is Chinese territory. We're not talking about large swaths of rebel territory not under control, nor are we talking about a wild west - we're talking about a province that is under the total control of the CCP which has been working on stamping out opposition using all sorts of methods - including migrating lots of Han Chinese into the region. We're not talking about a Waziristan or something here - the people who control the airports and bases out there *are the Chinese*\n\n* You're basically saying that China, one of the most closely monitored countries on Earth, not only allowed a 777 to enter its airspace undetected, but that it attempted to land at an airport and not a single person saw it or heard about it (esp. with all the monitoring that goes on electronically)\n\n* Furthermore, the motive question still comes up. If it was terrorism of the 9/11 kind, the plane would have just stayed on its original flight path to Beijing where it would have a plethora of targets in mind. Hijacking a plane full of hostages and trying to land it IN a country like China makes no sense - it would be like hijacking an American airline and landing it in Utah - you can already tell how illogical and stupid this idea would be.\n\n* China has 154 nationals on board. If the plane crashed after a hijacking by Uighurs, why would the Chinese not know or go to the lengths of covering it up? It would give them every excuse to step up their crushing of dissent in Xinjiang. And don't say the Chinese would be embarrassed that a plane got through - again, the CCP would be given a green light to their story of terrorism in Xinjiang AND the PLA would have the perfect reasoning for needing larger budget increases every year\n\n\n>1) This was not an accident or sudden catastrophe. The Malaysian government bluntly stated on Saturday that, \u201cThese movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane\u201d.\n\nAnd yet, two days ago, the Malaysian government *backtracked* on ACARS data saying that ACARS cannot be conclusively determined to have been disabled prior to last comms - instead, it could have been disabled anytime between 1:07 AM and 1:37AM, which changes the scope of the investigation *again*\n\n>Aksu Airport is only 70 miles from the last known \"ping\" location. The 4 fires are less that 50 miles from the airport, in the path of a flight's descent. The fires are clustered together within a 3 mile radius. 2 of the fires are very close, less than 1 mile apart.\n\nAgain, fitting too much evidence around a conclusion. A plane crashing on final approach, as you believe, would be coming in slow and low and wouldn't create fires spread out over a 3 mile radius. Indeed, look at any crash on final approach of airliners in the past couple decades - they don't start fires that rage across even half a mile, they're pretty concentrated - even for the ones that weren't at total fuel exhaustion like this flight would have been\n\n> The flight to Kuala Lumpur-Beijing is 2,700 miles. The flight range of a Boeing 777-200 Extended Range is up to 9,935 nautical miles. The search area now encompasses 2.24 million square miles.\n\nThe 777-200ER's max range is irrelevant - the plane would not have been fueled anywhere near the max - instead, it would have been fueled slightly beyond the range of the flight from KUL to PEK - which puts a flight to Aksu at its limits\n\nAnd read what the experts think about which corridor it is: [Reuters link](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/19/us-malaysiaairlines-flight-idUSBREA2701720140319)",

At least your \"conspiracy\" theory has basis in patterns and logic. \n\nHow about this to add to the conspiracy? Some people are shooting down (pun intended) your theory by saying the Chinese heavily patrol/radar that area. What if they shot it down?

Going north there an argument for navigating around radar, terrain (eg Himalayas) and geographic boundaries.\n\nThe other weakness is fuel range (and distance) calculated from well above the equator. Going south the search zone is at maximum fuel range.\n\nThe same logic going north at cruise speed and intersecting the ping lines still gets you around Kyrgyzstan.\n\nDespite what people have said, I don't think you can mirror the zone into the northern hemisphere because that implies something like 300kts speed rather than the likely 450-500kts\n\n",

That would lead to a path that wouldn't necessarily be mirrorable to the north.\n\nTo me, I don't discount it being a CYA thing, where they are focusing on the end of the aircraft's fuel range on the portion of the arc/potential flight path that might be outside of (or near the edge of) the range of both the US and Australia's radars - just to confirm the plane is in the northern corridor and make it look like we don't know it is there.

The transponder goes black.\n- The pilots realise that they need to land the plane ASAP and turn towards Langkawi\n- \u2026 they don't make it. \n\nNow, what about the plane finding itself in the southern indian ocean? Personal guess: realising that they won't make it, that passengers and crew are condemned, if not already dead, and that the plane is headed towards the villages and cities around Langkawi, the pilot sets the autopilot towards the Indian Ocean, to make sure that the plane will crash into water. \n\nNo need for equipment failure and communication loss, just the pilots turning off the equipment. Pilot impairment comes from the smoke of a fire\u2026 And the overall direction towards the biggest plane of water around matches one of the directions mentioned in your picture. The only strange odd still needed is \"plane being able to remain in flight\" - which could be the case with a tire in fire, as Goodfellow suggests. \n\nPersonally, I believe in Goodfellow's theory, because even if it calls for a set of relatively specific odds, it generally makes more sense that most of the other theories IMO.

[Pilot Bill Palmer explained a couple of days ago how a 777 with it's auto-pilot off could make altitude and course changes while staying in the air.](http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/16/opinion/palmer-malaysia-flight-370/)\n\n>On the technical side, the Boeing 777-200ER is a fly-by-wire airplane -- that is, movement of the controls is converted into electrical signals that interact with flight-control computers and instruct the plane's control surfaces on the wings and tail. Its characteristics may be able to explain much of the airplane's behavior.\n\n>With the autopilot off, the airplane will adjust the pitch (the up or down movement of the nose of the plane) to maintain a speed set by the pilot. It will pitch up if it's going faster than the desired speed and pitch down if slower. This is called pitch trim. Anyone who has flown even a small aircraft will be familiar with this concept. Therefore, when disturbed, it will fly a series of pitch changes as it settles down on the trimmed airspeed.\n\n>Pitch protections built into the system ensure that the airplane never goes too fast or too slow. Temporary input on the control wheel, or changes in the airplane's weight as it burns off fuel, temperature and other normal atmospheric changes along the course can initiate the altitude changes as the airplane continues to seek its trimmed speed.\n\n>Heading changes are also what I would expect to see in an autopilot-off situation. The 777's fly-by-wire roll control law controls the tilt of the wings. The airplane would be subject to atmospheric disturbances that could act to tip a wing up every now and then, but built-in protections prevent the plane from exceeding bank angles in excess of 35\u00b0. While a conventional airplane would tend to spiral down in that situation, the 777 incorporates automatic pitch compensation, so the airplane could easily hold its altitude in these turns.\n\n>The fly-by-wire control system on the 777 makes it a very stable airplane, capable of flying for hours with the autopilot off without crashing.

            "I agree with your logic, though I am not sure we have all the data on this particular plane for me to fully sign on. I don't know how plane manufacture and updating and recalling works.\n\nDo you know what happened with Swissair 111 in these regards? That was a mechanical failure (bad wiring in the inflight entertainment system) that seems like it would have had implications for other planes. I assume they must've known pretty quickly, though not immediately, and then addressed it. Were affected planes grounded?\n\nHere's why I think they (Boeing/gov) might NOT ground the fleet even if they thought it was a mechanical failure that all other 777s would be susceptible to:\n1. The huge effect on the world economy compared to the likely still low risk of a second catastrophic failure and the relatively low (~300) number of lives at risk. \n2. The ability to guess what the risk might or might not be (if indeed there was mechanical failure) and quietly add in more redundancies/safety features to address this (for example, if hypoxia is seen as a potential threat, adding alert systems, changing alert mechanisms, adding in back-up oxygen, etc.). \n3. I doubt we'd let Boeing fail financially. They're too well-connected in the U.S. to too many places and politicians. \n4. No replacements. My understanding is that planes are difficult to produce because of the amount of R&D, testing, etc., that goes into them. If you ground 777s, you are making a decision that deeply cuts into air travel for years. \n\nI am sure the U.S. gov and Boeing both know a lot more than we're being told, but that's mainly for other reasons besides the failure to ground the fleet. \n\nI also could see a political/economic benefit to calling it intentional when it's still possibly a totally unknown mechanical failure in order to AVOID the pressure to ground the fleet and with the reasonable assumption that if all other 777s are extra thoroughly checked and with more frequency, and given the historical safety record, it is very unlikely to happen again. And if it does happen again, then you apologize profusely, etc., talk about how it's such a rare strange failure that all the other things ONLY pointed to intentional hijacking, promise better planes, show remorse and regret, take responsibility, talk about how such safe flight nowadays has led to some complacency at all levels, set up a new oversight agency, sell planes mostly to the government until people have forgotten, and voila!

Obviously if we can't find any debris in the ocean, even something as simple as a t-shirt or a seat cushion then it's pretty obvious it landed somewhere which would lead to more of an investigation and we might have to have to go into a search effort similar to Bin Laden's.

            "I am assuming that 1) not all hijackers are out to announce what they've done -- it opens them up to being caught more easily, and 2) should they want to contact people, neither I nor Reddit threads will top their list of \"who to call\". I lean towards the first suggestion, that they have no desire to open up the lines of communication with governments. But I also think it could just as easily be the second and I don't know all of what is going on.\n\nMotive: not entirely sure. I think the Uighurs have a legitimate reason to be less than happy with the Chinese government. I think the Chinese government could have goals it aims to achieve at the expense of its own citizens. I suppose in some situations, there might be a prisoner trade. There's plenty of political unrest, people who don't feel heard, corruption, greed, etc.  \n\nSometimes it seems like people have a notion of hijacking that is pretty static. Why do we expect it to look the same each time? You know that old saying, *if you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always got*? Well, it applies to terrorists too. Most people act rational if you accept their underlying values and priorities and emotions. I assume hijackers don't decide to be hijackers on a whim -- they have a specific end in mind and at some point, hijacking seems like a means to that end. It's hard to see how the old model of hijacking -- take a plane, demand something from a government, return it and get your thing -- would work nowadays. There are whole schools of thought on how to deal with hostage situations, whether to negotiate with terrorists, etc. There's the NSA and satellites and GPS in all sorts of devices and RFID and tracking of all sorts. \n\n\nI am leaning towards the hijacking theory because the logistics of it fit up more easily with the data we currently have and it's considered the likely explanation by the agencies sharing that data.",

Your final payout at death would be the remainder of the benefit. If you don't die within 12 months, your benefit is still reduced by whatever you got as a terminal payout...

            "I just posted this but I think it bears repeating. \n\n[Pilot Bill Palmer explained a couple of days ago how a 777 with it's auto-pilot off could make altitude and course changes while staying in the air.](http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/16/opinion/palmer-malaysia-flight-370/)\n\n >On the technical side, the Boeing 777-200ER is a fly-by-wire airplane -- that is, movement of the controls is converted into electrical signals that interact with flight-control computers and instruct the plane's control surfaces on the wings and tail. Its characteristics may be able to explain much of the airplane's behavior.\n\n>With the autopilot off, the airplane will adjust the pitch (the up or down movement of the nose of the plane) to maintain a speed set by the pilot. It will pitch up if it's going faster than the desired speed and pitch down if slower. This is called pitch trim. Anyone who has flown even a small aircraft will be familiar with this concept. Therefore, when disturbed, it will fly a series of pitch changes as it settles down on the trimmed airspeed.\n\n>Pitch protections built into the system ensure that the airplane never goes too fast or too slow. Temporary input on the control wheel, or changes in the airplane's weight as it burns off fuel, temperature and other normal atmospheric changes along the course can initiate the altitude changes as the airplane continues to seek its trimmed speed.\n\n>Heading changes are also what I would expect to see in an autopilot-off situation. The 777's fly-by-wire roll control law controls the tilt of the wings. The airplane would be subject to atmospheric disturbances that could act to tip a wing up every now and then, but built-in protections prevent the plane from exceeding bank angles in excess of 35\u00b0. While a conventional airplane would tend to spiral down in that situation, the 777 incorporates automatic pitch compensation, so the airplane could easily hold its altitude in these turns.\n\n >The fly-by-wire control system on the 777 makes it a very stable airplane, capable of flying for hours with the autopilot off without crashing.\n\nIt is too early and not enough proof either way has been gathered to authoritatively dismiss any reasonable theory. I suspect we will not know what happened until the aircraft is recovered.",

I didn't wish that they would die, but I sure as hell wished that the situation would be over because that shit is bad -- it's hard to not know what will happen or when, it's hard to watch others suffer (especially those we love), it's hard to feel powerless. \n\nI mean, I guess you are the only one who can figure out if your thought is evil, but it doesn't sound like you want to hurt others or anything.

Can you explain how it has been refined?\n\nA: (shows search area) What we have done is to work with US NTSB which... has to be publicly noted... done some work on transmissions made from the aircraft at approx hourly intervals.  Those transmissions were detected by comms satellite over the Indian ocean and with the time and distance of those communications they can't plot an exact position but sequentially can be built into a possible flight path.  The search area is based on the last of those point and has been moved to account for water movement and weather since the 8th.\n\n(skipped Q)\n\nQ: Those transmissions - the last suggests this area?  Does that rule out of the rest of the search area?  How can you be so confident?\n\nA: What I present is a possible search area, analysis of possible movements of the aircraft, some assumptions are built in (such as speed).  The two arrows you see represent two different speeds.  What we're producing is a best estimate of the likely place to search.\n\nQ: Does this rule out the northern route.\n\nA: It's irrelevant.  The way the analysis is conducted, you get a mirror image in the north.  We're examining the southern one because that's our area.\n\nQ: Two analysis of the same set of data?\n\nA: Yes.  Produces mirror images on either side of the equator.

There have been no hostage demands, so - what would be the point of hostages? 240 people is an extraordinary number of people to keep imprisoned if you're not prepared for it, and if you're already planning on using the plane (ostensibly) to commit some form of terror involving a massive number of deaths, what do you care if you off 240 passengers? \n",

They did so shortly after it occurred, but their claims were disregarded by many due to the same sort of underestimating witnessed in many of these comments. Those claims are now being reevaluated.

I've also taken Helicopter rides over the grand canyon and the the Rocky Mountains.\n\nHere's the thing though - When in a plane small enough for skydiving, or a helicopter, there's a good chance that if it goes down.. I'm dead. There's little chance I'll survive. On a commercial liner, however, there's a chance I will survive (more safety features and what have you).

You theoretically COULD go out and buy another term life policy although individual polices are underwritten and you\u2019re probably not going to be approved for an additional policy if you were THAT sick that you were considered terminally ill then made a miraculous recovery. You could always obtain another policy if you obtain on a group chasse but there are underwriting guidelines over a certain threshold for those policies as well. This rarely comes up \u2013 insurance companies are kinda-sorta OK at assessing risk and usually only allow accelerated death benefits when they\u2019re positive the insured is going to die pretty soon. \nThe majority of passengers were Chinese and the life insurance industry only took off in the last decade, so this all could be a moot point (discussion).\n\n\nIn regards to the people on MH370, yeah, you might be able to go out and buy another policy if an individual policy paid out and then these people were found alive. Definitely up to how each country\u2019s insurance industry works plus the goodwill of the companies  - it would be a win from a publicity standpoint if the insurance company paid out the benefit and didn\u2019t ask for it back if the MH370 passengers are alive. I\u2019d have to research how 9/11 insurance claims were handled if you\u2019re interested. Business travel accident coverage and AD&D coverage will also kick in (specifically for those people who were travelling on business on the flight.)\n\nThis has marginal relevance to the rest of the MH370 thread but worth repeating: if you have life insurance / retirement funds (through work, individual policy, etc.) \u2013 MAKE SURE YOUR BENEFICIARIES ARE UP TO DATE, especially if you\u2019ve married/divorced/had kids recently, etc. Nothing is worse than having a claimant pass away and the money goes to someone he didn\u2019t intend to.

The info on the pre-programmed turn is coming from US sources, currently denied by the Malaysians, and I saw it reported that those sources do not know when exactly this turn was programmed in, pre-flight being a possibility.\n\nThe reported 12 minute gap is the one between the second ACARS burst at 1:07am and the last vocal \"All right, good night\" transmission at 1:19am. This shows that the US sources probably got their info from that ACARS burst and know that the alternative flightpath was programmed in before that point. Given that a primary ACARS burst had taken place during lift-off, and the US sources don't know whether or not the programming was carried out before lift-off, this shows that the first ACARS burst also included the programmed change. Thus the programming was done at some point prior to the first burst. So, conflicting with the reporting of the 12 minutes.\n\nThis matter is indicative of the whole investigation, conflicting information, changing information, unverified information, all bubbling away while we try to make sense of what happened.

When closest, the aircraft's cabin was lit up and the captain could feel their heat in his face. These two craft departed before a third, much larger disk-shaped object started trailing them, causing the pilots to request a change of course. Anchorage Air Traffic Control obliged and requested an oncoming United Airlines flight to confirm the unidentified traffic, but when it and a military craft sighted JAL 1628 at about 5:51 PM, no other craft could be distinguished.

Whats more the reaction 3 H2 + N2 \u2192 2 NH3  (\u0394H = \u221292.22 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121).  The '\u0394H' is called the 'enthalpy of formation' and is the energy required to move from the left to the right.  The value given is actually says this reaction should run on its own but it doesn't really.  Unfortunately while the net reaction is favorable left to right, there is a BIG hill to climb.  That N2 molecule has three bonds holding it (thats a lot of bonds) and is a very tough thing to break apart.  Once the reaction is over the hill its more stable on the other side but it takes enormous energy to push it over that hill hence the extreme reaction conditions.  Also note the hydrogen, that's three molecules of hydrogen for every molecule of nitrogen (both hydrogen and nitrogen are found in the di-atomic state, not as individual atoms).  When hydrogen reacts with oxygen in the air, [things explode](http://youtu.be/nLuOM9aOWvk?t=1m30s).  When those balloons are scaled up to industry sizes and 100x the pressure then the explosion becomes what you see.\n\nLong story short, nitrogen fixation facilities are scary things.

In Texas. Rural towns just don't operate with the same mentality as larger cities. It's hard to understand if you have never lived in a town like this. Smaller budgets, very little accountability, nepotism,  all these things contribute to a very different and laid-back way of operating. In a larger city, the people running it are strangers to most of the general public. In a town like this, the mayor might be your cousin and dentist, or the police chief might be his brother-in-law who also runs a poplular restaurant in town. It makes setting zoning laws and city ordinances both more complicated and a little less formal. \n\nI think that in spite of all these factors, plus the shock of being thrust into the national spotlight out of the blue, people in the community have done an amazing job of pulling together and doing what needs to be done, especially those first emergency/fire/police personnel who have had to do such a difficult job despite knowing that some of their closest friends, coworkers, and maybe even family may have died in this explosion. \n\nThe most that can be hoped for at this point are fewer fatalities than expected and maybe some miraculous rescues. There will be plenty of time later to find out who was at fault. ",

I doubt this, as China takes such things VERY seriously.\n\n2. The people with the fakes had a connecting flight straight away or within 48 hours. I'd assume it would be easy enough to check booked tickets out of Beijing against passport numbers/names.\n\n3.

I don't remember which plane but I remember when a plane lost air pressure and did this thing where it flies in a spiral down. It's controlled and everything but it's to get to a lower altitude where the pressure difference isn't so much.

This is because things like storms and ships can cause large waves that might trigger a false positive, and also because by the point that an earthquake causes the actual \"tsunami wave\" on the ocean surface it's usually too late to perform evacuations. Instead, tsunami buoys use pressure recorders to monitor the sea floor for seismic activity, sea level changes, or abrupt spikes in oceanic pressure. The \"buoy\" part (what you see bobbing on the water) is actually just the communications relay to transmit the data to a forecast center (in China's case, the State Oceanographic Agency). \n\nA plane crash would barely even register as a blip to a tsunami buoy unless the plane happened to hit the water EXTREMELY close or right on top of one (which, given the size of the sea relative to the number of buoys deployed, would be like you or I getting struck by lightning randomly).",

It has to be a very soft landing for it to happen too, and in that case, pilots could have the chance to call for distress, and people could of escaped. So, no.",

The ships and planes searching for debris would then have to check every piece of floating crap to see if it was merely trash or part of the plane.  That would be a painfully slow process.  \n\nThey'll find debris, probably already have, we just may not hear about it for a couple days.  ",

This aircraft is much newer than 747 and was designed and analyzed with the aid of computer, meaning most of the aircraft is much stronger and more durable.\n\nThere are ways of safely crash landing into water that causes very minimal amounts of damage to the fuselage. The wings could easily break off, fill with water, and be submerged. The fuselage could suffer some damage from the crash, and would eventually submerge. The engines would more than likely be the only thing that would be particularly difficult to not throw off a bunch of scrap metal that would eventually find its way to a coast.\n\nSource: I am a structural engineer for aircrafts",

            "Commenting in response to this comment since the original was deleted (basically asking why all the media attention) - \n\nThere are a few reasons why this is not just a regular plane crash (statistically speaking, plane crashes are hardly regular). I think the intense focus on this event is due to not so much the \"what\" of the event as the \"why\" and the \"how\".\n\n\nThe circumstances are extremely mysterious. The 777 has a stellar safety record and at that point in time the plane had been on cruise control, the safest portion of any flight. Incidents typically happen upon takeoff or on landing. If the plane had run into technical issues, even serious ones, the pilots would have made contact with air control. If something so serious caused the plane to blow up in the air, what could it have been?\n\nThat throws suspicion on the possibility of terrorism. Given the number of Chinese citizens on the plane, speculation is revolving around the possibility that Uighur activists may have been responsible. That, too, seems unlikely given that at this point we have not heard anything about any group claiming responsibility.\n\n\nThe media is focusing on this because it could have serious implications, if not political, then on safety issues for the 777 and other commercial airlines. Not to mention the terrible human tragedy of losing the 239 people who boarded that flight that day.\n\nFor me, personally, I have flown across Southeast Asia many, many times and I can't believe how this could have happened. My heart breaks for the people on the flight, and their family members and friends. It could have been any one of us. As a result, all of us are looking for answers, and closure.",

Staticky but non-panicked radio contact was made shortly before their disappearance by another plane and no distress calls were received, indicating that whatever happened was rather sudden.  The Vietnam Navy confirmed the crash location despite no visible wreckage being found.  \n\nBased off what we know, it's my suspicion that the plane suffered a catastrophic failure of the structure and broke apart at altitude.   A seemingly similar incident has already occurred where a China Airlines B747 (Flight 611) suddenly disappeared from ATC radar.  In that case it was determined that the plane broke apart at altitude by examining primary radar data and observing a starburst pattern emanating from the blip that used to be the plane around the location that ATC radars had made last contact. I would be interested in seeing a log of primary radar for the area of MH370 because a loss of power (777s shouldn't ever lose power to their transponders in flight, even with a double engine failure) could cause a plane to disappear from transponder-based solutions. \n\nPrimary radar is far more primitive (it bounces radio off of anything and everything instead of receiving from a transponder) and could possibly reveal some information about what may have happened.  ATC towers usually do have access to it but don't use it often because it provides no altitude data. Oh, and a final note: Dynasty 611 was difficult to locate and had very little visible wreckage because it spread over a very large area on its way down from cruise altitude.  611 crashed because of poor maintenance.\n\n**TL;DR:  Based on the information so far, I think MH370 suffered a catastrophic structural failure and disintegrated at altitude.  Compare to the case of China Airlines 611.**\n\n**EDIT: Another possibility is a crash analogous to Air France 447, which disappeared into the Atlantic without a trace north of Brazil.**",

            "I understand that there are a huge amount of safety features baked into the design.  I do hope you're not trying to argue that the crashes I've talked about didn't happen, because ignoring them is a good way to allow things like that to happen again.   It's one thing to say that \"planes don't disintegrate\" and suite another to say their structure is incapable of failing.  Please do enlighten me more on the subject if you have some sort of design source that illustrates a 777 can survive a nosedive from 30000 feet, because that's really pushing the limits of physics.\n\nBy \"catastrophic structural failure\" I mean to say that the wings, horizontal stabilizers, or vertical stabilizer separated from the fuselage in some form of overstress event.  It's happened before on a 747 - a design that is very safe too.  The design wasn't the problem; maintenance was.  I don't know what planes you design or what company you work for, but I would not feel safe on a plane that's designed by overly confident engineers and I hope that you feel the same.  Every design has a limit, especially when it isn't maintained right.  \n\nCAL 611 did not disintegrate immediately.  It broke into a few pieces at altitude and small pieces broke off as those pieces began to disintegrate during their descent.  That's the only way primary radar could have seen the starburst.  The big pieces hit the water and mostly sank while many of the smaller items did float.  All in all, ~15% of the wreck was recovered.\n\nEDIT If a plane suffers a catastrophic structural failure as I've described, I can show a multitude of instances where the airplane breaks completely apart while still in flight.  GLO 1907 is a good starting point - it had part of it's left wing clipped off by the winglet of a passing Embraer.  After a short while, the 737-8 broke apart.\nAIC 182, a 747-200 met quick end when its structure failed subsequent to a bombing over the atlantic.  The same thing happened to PAA 103 (old 747-100) over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.  They may be rare, but just as crashes are rare, structural failures still happen.  It's quite rare for a significantly structurally damaged airplane to make a landing at all, let alone a safe one.  The only incident that comes to my mind where that happened is the famous near-crash of AAH 243, which had its roof peel back in flight.  ",
            "Is there a source stating contact from another plane was false? There were several articles interviewing that pilot contacting 370. Not sure who's telling the truth anymore!",
            "CAL 611 broke up almost instantaneously, as tends to happen when a major failure occurs at ~35,000 feet (the plane deviated from its plan and ascended shortly before suffering the failure).\n\nThe lack of oil slick is puzzling though.  CAL 611's wreckage was found on land up to 130 km from the point of breakup and left bodies and oil on the water. If this crash occurred in a similar way, it would presumably be evident and contained completely in the South China Sea.  It is possible for the bodies to sink if the water is cold enough.  That's rather doubtful given the latitude of the sea.  I'm making the assumption that the still floating pieces of wreckage and the bodies are small and dispersed widely enough that they are difficult to spot from the air.\n\nWhat makes me think it's not something else is that if it were a crash similar to AFR 447 which stalled into the Atlantic and disappeared for two years, radar would have caught the descent (possibly not if ATC was using ancient equipment).  If it were like the final dive of ASA 261 which had a mechanical failure at low altitude and nosedived into the Pacific off the California coast, the 777 airframe would've overstressed from the speed and broken apart before hitting the water.  There really aren't any other ways for a plane to simply disappear at altitude like that.  It's nearly impossible for a structurally intact 777 to lose power to its transponder, and that wouldn't hide the plane from primary radar.  A final and unthinkable possibility is a crash like that of MSR 990: a controlled and deliberate flight into the sea.\n\nIt certainly didn't land, either.  Nobody wouldn't question a mysterious 777 that appeared from nowhere on radar and landed at an airport not listed on a flight plan.  And there aren't many places that can accommodate a plane like that anyway.  If something caused them to land at an airfield, the crew surely would've alerted the airline.  That leaves only a few possibilities for what happened, and of those I still suspect a mid-air breakup is the most likely.\n\nI didn't know of the contact being disproven.  Either way, the lack of comms is highly unusual.",
            "Actually, the wreckage wouldn't be exactly where it lost contact.\n\nThe plane is moving at a considerable speed - 470ish knots. The position it lost contact would mean the planes debris (IF an explosion happened) would be considerably farther ahead. Not only that, but at that altitude, winds are in the tens to hundreds of miles per hour - debris would rain a considerable distance.\n\nWhich actually makes the fact that no debris have been found more puzzling - IF it exploded or disintegrated in air, the debris field would be spread over a wide area. So far, nothing has been found - which suggests it is concentrated in a smaller area.",

            "If you only count spontaneous failure of the structure of a plane due to design faults, that stopped happening to airliners in the early '50s with the DH Comets' square window problem.  Other design faults have caused complete hull losses for sure - the 737's rudder hard over problem is a good and recent example. But lots of things can damage the structure and otherwise cause failure, including fires, poor maintenance, and explosions.  These are things that all planes generally aren't designed to withstand and so it is completely understandable that it would cause parts of the plane to separate.  That *is* a structural failure, albeit one that is induced.  I didn't allude too strongly to the cause of my theory on MH370's demise.  I'm under the impression that the airline is performing proper maintenance checks and is reasonably proactive, but I really don't know.  \n\nIt could've been anything: a bombing, a maintenance problem, a design fault, a mid-air collision with a GA aircraft not equipped with a transponder even (how's *that* for a doubtful scenario?).  A structure that is weakened by whatever cause will be easier to overstress and sometimes impossible not to if the plane is no longer capable of flight.  It's not as if 777s are designed to handle the loads that would be present during a 30,000 foot plunge at any rate, at least with the assumption that the wings are generating lift.

I know there was a lot of panicking going on, and I'm sure there are more issues at work than that, but it's always seemed a bit confusing to me why they weren't able to just try to reset the controls to how they were before the pitot tubes froze up and they lost speed info. Is it just because now things are computerized pilots just set a speed target and don't need to concentrate so much on what throttle level is actually used to maintain that?",

            ">Who the pulls back on the stick during a stall?\n\nI recall a very detailed thread somewhere where a pilot with Airbus experience went into a lot of detail about what happens to the instruments when the pitot tube is blocked. His explanation made the pilots' behavior a little more understandable.\n\nI can't find that thread,  but here's [an article with similar information](http://www.avweb.com/news/airman/184279-1.html?redirected=1).  The key points:\n\n~~**Altimeter:**~~ \n~~>\"An altimeter affected by a blocked static system will simply **continue to show the same reading** it had when the blockage occurred.\"~~  \n\nEDIT:  I read the article again a little more closely,  and it said the altimeter would not be affected by a frozen pitot tube.  \n\n**Air Speed Indicator:** \n>Should the pitot tube become suddenly blocked ... it would probably go unnoticed in level flight. In a climb or a descent, however, **an airspeed indicator relying on a blocked pitot tube would behave like an altimeter**. ... As you climb, the static pressure will become less, the trapped pitot pressure will remain the same, and the increasing difference between the two would be shown as increasing airspeed. \n\nNotice what it said about the air speed indicator:  as the plane climbed it showed the airspeed increasing.\n\nSo the pilot was operating the controls in such a way as to make the airspeed indicator increase.  Which really is the desired effect when stall warnings are being shouted.  ~~And the altimeter wasn't changing its reading,  so the pilot was not aware he was climbing.~~  EDIT:  see comment above.\n\nYour point is still valid:  well-trained pilots should still know that you just can't pull back on the stick for a couple of solid minutes when a stall is imminent.  And when the senior pilot on board figured out what the guy flying was doing,  he freaked out,  took over the controls himself,  and started doing the right things.  But by then it was too late.\n\nBut I think it is a very interesting nugget of information that is rarely reported in articles about the crash:  the stuff the pilot did in the cockpit was probably making the airspeed indicator increase.  He very likely had a reason for what he did.\n",

            "They won't confirm anything I think, not until they have found the aircraft. I am just using educated guesses.\n\nIt's hard to answer because things could have failed very quickly and in a big way, this is my bet from what I know. So if there was a catastrophic failure and the plane broke apart, then everything breaks. \n\nIf you took a sledge hammer to your PC, then it's likely you would lose it's Internet access. From experience the main cause of this information not to be sent and a complete loss of communications is a break up in flight, it would cause everything to fail.\n\nThere is massive redundancy, sure there could be events that cause the all transponders to fail and other systems as well but these are unlikely, it looks more like everything failed in a very quick moment.   \n\nIf that total failure did not happen, then MA has some data more than likely, they get the telemetry of all primary systems and their status, altitude, airspeed, attitude, heading, engine status, fuel levels, all alarms basically a great deal of data from over 100 sensors.\n\nThese are sent in snapshots that can be changed, on my aircraft it's 30 seconds, some operators are longer and can be 15 minutes, this can be also be changed remotely and on a sensor by sensor basis, turning some on in real time. Some serious alarms are sent immediately as well. \n\nSome operators don't do this but these are generally smaller regional firms, I would highly suspect MA does. \n \nWhole problem with these accidents is everyone keeps quiet until they have a fuller picture, what makes it hard is even if you have some position information when contact was lost (and they 100% do due to ADS-B), the plane was 7 miles high, even a few degrees change in heading can make a lot of difference to where it ends up.\n\nYes they should have some better data unless the aircraft blew apart and caused everything to fail. If a plane vanishes from radar, something is really wrong. In case you don't know, ATC's radar normally doesn't scan the skies and looks for targets that bounce back, it's normally a listening station that gets transponder messages from the aircraft. The fact this just vanished like the transponder has been turned off, again points to a complete aircraft failure.  \n\nIf that is the case, now they will be looking for the beacons for the flight data recorders, these can transmit over a month.  \n\n ",

            "My understanding is that the less experienced pilot at the controls reacted to the initial (incorrect) air speed reading, thinking the aircraft was travelling dangerously fast and in danger of breaking up, by assuming a nose up position. The experienced captain never assumed control of the aircraft after being re-called to the cockpit and the plane went into the ocean after four minutes. That isn't really long when you have multiple warnings going off, and no idea if you are reacting to the correct malfunction. ",

I'm just not sure what the problem with dropping the nose to 0 degrees angle of attack and even throttling back, if you really think overspeed is an issue, would have been.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\ntemporary inconsistency between the measured speeds, likely as a result of the obstruction of the pitot tubes by ice crystals, causing autopilot disconnection and reconfiguration to alternate law;\nthe crew made inappropriate control inputs that destabilized the flight path;\nthe crew failed to follow appropriate procedure for loss of displayed airspeed information;\nthe crew were late in identifying and correcting the deviation from the flight path;\nthe crew lacked understanding of the approach to stall;\nthe crew failed to recognize that the aircraft had stalled and consequently did not make inputs that would have made it possible to recover from the stall.\n",

The photo belongs to a boat motor accident.\n* Access to social media sites are banned. Although in Taksim, Istanbul 3G access is banned, social media sites can not be accessed because of the traffic.\n* Thousands of police officers have resigned. This is also confirmed wrong, about 20 or 30 police officers confirmed to be resigned.\n* Head of the Istanbul Police Headquarters has resigned. Confirmed wrong, as a fake Twitter account spread it.\n* Police using real bullets. If they have used real bullet, this is massacre not intervention.\n* A protester who tried to stop an armed vehicle has died. No, he is alive. A fake identity had given to him, in order to make people believe that he is dead.\n* Police officers spraying tear gas to dogs. This photo is not from Turkey, it is from Italy since \"Policia\" is written on the backs of polices instead of \"Polis\".\n* Besiktas supporters claimed one of the armed vehicles. This was unconfirmed last night and before that. Now it is known that it is not true.\n* Police officers fainted protesters with chemical water. Tens of thousands people had shared this in social media but this is not true.\n* News channels' fake twitter accounts. There are many fake accounts of Turkish news channels.\n* If the protest lasts 48 hours, Turkish Constitutional Court have the right to cancel the current government. This is also not true, it was a made-up rumor in order to make protests last longer.\n* Agent Orange used in protests. Agent Orange is a chemical which can simply massacre tons of protesters. It was a report in CNN's iReport site but in iReport site, users reports their own views.\n* Beyazit Ozturk's show cancelled permanently because of his own cancellation. Beyazit only cancelled this week's program.\n* 2012 Eurasia Marathon's photos used for yesterday mornings cross of the Bogazici Bridge. There were some true photos, but some of the photos belonged to last year's marathon.\n* CNN International had terminated their contract with CNN Turk. We are hoping that they will terminate, but for now this is only a hoax.\n* Protesters attacked women who were wearing turban.
