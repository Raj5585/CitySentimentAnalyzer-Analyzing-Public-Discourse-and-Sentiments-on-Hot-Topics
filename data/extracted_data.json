This is confirmed as wrong.\n* Photo of a young man, crushed by armed police vehicle. This is also confirmed wrong. The photo belongs to a boat motor accident.\n* Access to social media sites are banned. Although in Taksim, Istanbul 3G access is banned, social media sites can not be accessed because of the traffic.\n* Thousands of police officers have resigned. This is also confirmed wrong, about 20 or 30 police officers confirmed to be resigned.\n* Head of the Istanbul Police Headquarters has resigned. Confirmed wrong, as a fake Twitter account spread it.\n* Police using real bullets. If they have used real bullet, this is massacre not intervention.\n* A protester who tried to stop an armed vehicle has died. No, he is alive. A fake identity had given to him, in order to make people believe that he is dead.\n* Police officers spraying tear gas to dogs. This photo is not from Turkey, it is from Italy since \"Policia\" is written on the backs of polices instead of \"Polis\".\n* Besiktas supporters claimed one of the armed vehicles. This was unconfirmed last night and before that. Now it is known that it is not true.\n* Police officers fainted protesters with chemical water. Tens of thousands people had shared this in social media but this is not true.\n* News channels' fake twitter accounts. There are many fake accounts of Turkish news channels.\n* If the protest lasts 48 hours, Turkish Constitutional Court have the right to cancel the current government. This is also not true, it was a made-up rumor in order to make protests last longer.\n* Agent Orange used in protests. Agent Orange is a chemical which can simply massacre tons of protesters. It was a report in CNN's iReport site but in iReport site, users reports their own views.\n* Beyazit Ozturk's show cancelled permanently because of his own cancellation. Beyazit only cancelled this week's program.\n* 2012 Eurasia Marathon's photos used for yesterday mornings cross of the Bogazici Bridge. There were some true photos, but some of the photos belonged to last year's marathon.\n* CNN International had terminated their contract with CNN Turk. We are hoping that they will terminate, but for now this is only a hoax.\n* Protesters attacked women who were wearing turban. This is also a hoax, there were many women protesters who were wearing turban\n* Source: http://www.fatihcipil.com/2013/06/gezi-park-olayndaki-11-yalan-haber.html",

            "Thoughts on the mountain and the broken axle:\n\nIf you suggest that Dorner went that way (up the mountain) as part of his plan, then it stands to reason that his truck would've been up that way before. He seems very calculated.\nSo either:\n1) He had really, really bad luck.\n2) The truck had never been there before.\n\nThe first choice is a viable possibility. A quick google search showed that his truck model has had axle problems.\nThe second choice leads to more options:\n1) Did he panic and choose that route?\n2) Is the truck a diversion altogether?\n\nThe first option is, again, completely viable. He is someone who understands the severity of his actions better than anyone. Only he knows how truly fucked he is.\nThe second option, again, leads to more questions than I can even list...\n\nWith regards to the \"broken axle\" on the truck:\n1) The gas tanks on those trucks sit against the rear axle. (Thank you GIS)\n2) The truck was ablaze.\n\nWhen the tank went, it quite possibly killed the axle.\n\nAlso, the differential fluid boiling point is well below the temps that inferno got up to.\nSealed case + boiling liquid = crack.\n\nWith that, I say: I can't say for certain the axle was broken from the mountain and not the fire. If we agree that's possible, then we're right\nback at \"the truck is a diversion.\"",
            "truck is probably a decoy, and they never had a trail of him in the mountains. hes a 270lb man, no way he doesnt leave track behind even on \"frozen snow\" and with good trackers and aerial view, he'd have been found pretty easily.\n\nhe probably had a back up car parked where he parked his truck, MAYBE made a half trail in to the mountains and came back down, torch the truck and got in the back up car and is probably driving through colorado or washington.",

He's very calculated, but I think releasing his manifesto, assuming that he did write and release it, was a poor choice.  It made his targets much more difficult access.\n\nI am prior service military, not attached to any kind of special combat unit.  I currently work in LE, but I'm not a cop.  My military training was more combat oriented than his was, but he didn't learn any of this lone operator survival stuff he's doing in the military if what's been released so far is the extent of his training.",

It was really a giant pain in the ass to find the right part and disable the DRLs so when I read the part about the truck not having it's lights on when the cops spotted it I immediately thought to myself, \"That's a load of crap!\".

He basically got fired for defending an innocent victim of excessive police force.\nThat woman he accused, Teresa Evans, kicked the shit out of a disabled dude just because she knew that he didn't know a damn thing about law. They even had video proof of it. Her attorney admitted off record that Teresa kicked him. Dorner's attorney knew he was innocent, but didn't mind Dorner getting fired because the department was waving lots of dollars in his face.\n\n**tl;dr - Teresa kicked the shit out of a bum, Dorner reported it and got fired.**\n\nThe end result?
