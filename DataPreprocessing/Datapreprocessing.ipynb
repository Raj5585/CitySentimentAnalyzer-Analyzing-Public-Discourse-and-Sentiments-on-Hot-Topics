It's possible they would have still gone red given what happened in Miami-Dade, but it wouldn't have been by the margins we saw on election night. Georgia also has a gerrymandered map that all but assured that the results would be 9 R, 5 D (it used to be 8 R, 6 D before the redraw in 2020). I could go on...\\n\\nMost Dem states did not have as heavily gerrymandered maps, either because the courts rejected them (looking at you New York) or because they rely on nonpartisan commissions to draw the maps instead of partisan state legislatures. \\n\\nFocus on New York for just a second: Because Dems did not gerrymander that map as hard as they wanted to, Republicans were able to make several pickups there. It's a good thing because it means that voters are able to pick their representatives (which is how our democracy should function), but it also means that Dems played fairly while Republicans did not. \\n\\nAnd so, Republicans just barely getting control of the House is frankly embarrassing given all these factors.\",\n",

       " 'Okay, I think I\\'m going to post a bit about Uvalde because there are so many misconceptions about this town on this site that it really bothers me. For background, my family is from Uvalde, my grandparents live two blocks behind Robb Elementary, and we\\'re probably fifth or sixth generation Mexican Americans dating back to Texas\\'s revolution. I didn\\'t grow up in the town, my dad did, I did spend every summer there growing up, and go back every Christmas or Thanksgiving. I lay this out to be clear that while I am very familiar with the community, I do not live there and any one who does feel free to correct anything I post.\\n\\nFirst of all, there are two main demographics in Uvalde. Whites and Mexican Americans, the Mexican Americans I will focus the most on because I think this portion of the population is most misunderstood by reddit and the internet at large.\\n\\nThe *vast* majority of Mexican Americans in this town are also fifth and sixth generation like my own family. This means that they are very Americanized and may not act how many of you expect. For a small example, the town itself is *not* pronounced by them the way TV anchors do it. You will not hear anyone there call it Oo-vall-deh but U-vahl-day. Yep, just like how white people say it.\\n\\nUvalde has many farms, ranches, and deer leases in or around it. If you do not work for or own any of these land types, you know someone who does. Many of the people who live or work or have connections to these places use guns every single day for work, to protect livestock, or for food during hunting season.\\n\\nUvalde is close to the border. While many people here do not hate illegal immigrants, they also are not particularly open to them either. The Mexican Americans here have issues with any perceived crimes that may or may not be committed by illegal immigrants. They don\\'t want to see them mistreated necessarily, but they are also not of the mind that illegal immigrants are their \"people\" in the sense that immigrants are a make or break it voting issue for them.\\n\\nFollowing this point, Uvalde does not hate Border Patrol. They\\'re actually very neutral towards it, and it is not uncommon for them to seek a career in their ranks. A few of the responding Border Patrol agents at Robb grew up in Uvalde.\\n\\nWhat do the people of Uvalde believe in? The *are* conservative in that many of their industry and livelihoods are aligned with conservative values. As farmers and ranchers, they are going to vote in the interests of gun rights and land ownership.\\n\\nMany Mexican Americans in Uvalde are culturally Catholic, and a significant amount attend mass. Abortion is not going to be a make or break issue for them this cycle because they already lean against it anyway. However, they tend not to be the fire and brimstone evangelical type of conservative. Machismo culture is common in older generations, but is waning among younger people here.\\n\\nUvalde does not trust its police department. This is something the internet kind of got right. They are not happy, and are acting more belligerent towards its officers than before, or they were when I last spoke with my family.\\n\\nHowever, this is where I think the breakdown happens on how reddit believes Uvalde should respond. They are not going to vote against their own gun rights. Many of the people here do not give a flying fuck about Greg Abbott in their day to day lives. The govenor does not affect them, in their minds, on this granular of a level. Unless said governor started to campaign against guns.\\n\\nBecause, one, they are still culturally and practically attached to guns on a significant level. Their response to further threats against their community is to arm *themselves,* tell the police to fuck off, and handle community threats and breakdowns the same way they always have.\\n\\nOn their own.\\n\\nWhen talking about the shooter, a lot of emphasis is placed on his family. Where were they? Why were his parents such failures? His grandmother did the best she could. Ect. Mexican Americans in particular in Uvalde handle issues with individuals within the family. It is a common belief that if his parents were in his life, maybe we wouldn\\'t be here. I\\'m not going to say whether that view is correct or not, I\\'m providing it here to highlight that Uvalde is very self-reliant in this manner. They view the police as having failed them, so they are going to take care of themselves.\\n\\nWith all this said, Uvalde was *never* going to vote in masse for Beto because of his stance on guns. Abortion, the environment, property taxes, *none* of these things were their big ticket issue this election.\\n\\nGuns were.\\n\\nAgree with them or not, Uvalde is considered a \"large\" town in its area because it\\'s pretty much the largest town or city between itself and San Antonio. As it grew, it was self reliant and independent on most its needs as it developed. It is not and probably will never be a blue county and will not vote the way reddit or twitter or any left leaning social media site expects or wishes them to.\\n\\nThey are in many ways a conservative people in the same manner old school conservatives once were before radicals gained control of the GOP. The Mexican Americans here are by *no means* Trump or QAnon psychos the way current Republicans are. But they are not a left leaning people either.\\n\\nDemocrats can reach them and more parts of Texas if they field a candidate who is more realistic to Texas\\'s cowboy, independent, rugged past and mythos.\\n\\nI\\'m sure there are even more facets to how this vote turned out, but I wanted to post what I know of Uvalde because I am so fucking sick of ignorant posts (not so much this parent post) on this site and elsewhere posting complete bullshit about Uvalde, and for what? Upvotes? Clout? Because I don\\'t spot true empathy in them. If there were, they\\'d bother to learn at least *a little* about who they are. So many people have never been here or spoken to anyone from Uvalde, and it\\'s frustrating to read bad takes about them.',\n",

       " \"So, there's a couple things at play here.  \\n  \\nLong story short, the midterms almost always result in a loss of seats for the party that holds the Presidency, and it's just a question of by how big the loss is.  At least in the modern political era there has only been one exception to this which is 2002 where the Democrats got completely wiped out because W had the 9/11 boost on his side, and there was a huge rally around the flag effect.  \\n  \\nOn top of that, Republican voters typically show up to midterms more often than Democrat voters, this has been the case basically since the 60's when you started getting the current day liberal/conservative splits in the parties.  The first time this effect hasn't been since since the days of LBJ's presidency was the 2018 midterms and now the 2022 midterms (I'm not sure on exact turnout yet, but early voting which is mostly Democrats broke 2018 records).  \\n  \\nAs such, as we went into midterms which are traditionally bad for Democrats for the previously mentioned reasons, there is a Democrat president which gives Republicans a boost.  Then Biden isn't really someone people are enthusiastic about, and largely ambivalent towards for his supporters which suppresses Democrat turnout, he's simply not a guy who generates hype.  \\n  \\nOn top of these issues you have national problems going on right now.  There is near double digit inflation happening which is normally a huge political issue (inflation ended Carters political career as well as Bush Sr, worries of inflation hamstrung Clinton, and fears of inflation both lead to the 2008 Obama supermajority and the subsequent wipeout of Democrats in each election after).  Then you have high gas prices, which are again a sensitive issue to people.  \\n  \\nOutside of highly visible issues like mentioned, the last two years have seen unprecedented levels of voter suppression measures taken.  Pennsylvania threw out a bunch of mail in ballots without telling people the day before election day, then forbid those people from voting in person.  Several districts had no process in place to resolve this.  Florida engaged in disenfranchisement by violating their felon voting rights reform, and then arresting people they said could vote.  Texas used a one size fits all approach to polling places, giving precincts of a couple thousand people the same numbers of machines, space, and poll workers as precincts with a 100,000 voters, and so on.  And of course there is the gerrymandered map issue such as states like Ohio and North Carolina which defended their redrawn districts in court, with the defense that the intent was to prevent Democrats from voting and winning elections, citing a SCOTUS ruling that drawing districts in a way to generate a partisan advantage is constitutional.   \\n  \\nAll of these things should have resulted in an absolute bloodbath for Democrats, and a huge win for Republicans.  Because of this, it's not really the end result that is being measured here, but rather that result against expectations based on the above as well as things such as polling data.    \\n  \\nTo say Republicans did bad in this election is an understatement.  They under performed relative to expectations by such a historically bad amount, that this is one of the worst election results in their parties history.  \\n  \\nThere's not really enough data in yet to give exact reasons (there's a lot of reasons, but how much each impacted voters is tough to say right now), but prior to last night, Republicans having 60 in the Senate and 260 in the House was legitimately on the table if they had a good night.  Instead they're in almost the same spot they were before the election, in what should have been a very favorable election for them.  \\n  \\nAnd that's before we get into the governor elections which was a another historically bad turnout for Republicans.  Republicans have held a huge advantage in gubernatorial races for decades, so much so that a major long term policy goal of the party was to control enough of those offices that they could call a convention of states and control the outcome.  They have been within striking distance of it multiple times.  Not a single incumbent lost their seat in elections this year, but all non incumbents went to Democrats, resulting in a gain of either 2 or 3 seats for Democrats (I think there's still one undecided looking at the results).  \\n  \\nPolling, political climate, timing, and so on should have had Republicans gain a large majority in the House and Senate while likely gaining a governor or two.  Instead they lost governor seats, aren't getting the Senate (and maybe even losing seats), and are getting what's looking to be an extremely narrow majority in the House.  As far as results go for Republicans, this is awful.  Oh, they lost several state legislatures too.\\nEdit:  Couple small edits to add some more historical context that puts the shifts into perspective.\",\n",

       " 'Okay, I think I\\'m going to post a bit about Uvalde because there are so many misconceptions about this town on this site that it really bothers me. For background, my family is from Uvalde, my grandparents live two blocks behind Robb Elementary, and we\\'re probably fifth or sixth generation Mexican Americans dating back to Texas\\'s revolution. I didn\\'t grow up in the town, my dad did, I did spend every summer there growing up, and go back every Christmas or Thanksgiving. I lay this out to be clear that while I am very familiar with the community, I do not live there and any one who does feel free to correct anything I post.\\n\\nFirst of all, there are two main demographics in Uvalde. Whites and Mexican Americans, the Mexican Americans I will focus the most on because I think this portion of the population is most misunderstood by reddit and the internet at large.\\n\\nThe *vast* majority of Mexican Americans in this town are also fifth and sixth generation like my own family. This means that they are very Americanized and may not act how many of you expect. For a small example, the town itself is *not* pronounced by them the way TV anchors do it. You will not hear anyone there call it Oo-vall-deh but U-vahl-day. Yep, just like how white people say it.\\n\\nUvalde has many farms, ranches, and deer leases in or around it. If you do not work for or own any of these land types, you know someone who does. Many of the people who live or work or have connections to these places use guns every single day for work, to protect livestock, or for food during hunting season.\\n\\nUvalde is close to the border. While many people here do not hate illegal immigrants, they also are not particularly open to them either. The Mexican Americans here have issues with any perceived crimes that may or may not be committed by illegal immigrants. They don\\'t want to see them mistreated necessarily, but they are also not of the mind that illegal immigrants are their \"people\" in the sense that immigrants are a make or break it voting issue for them.\\n\\nFollowing this point, Uvalde does not hate Border Patrol. They\\'re actually very neutral towards it, and it is not uncommon for them to seek a career in their ranks. A few of the responding Border Patrol agents at Robb grew up in Uvalde.\\n\\nWhat do the people of Uvalde believe in? The *are* conservative in that many of their industry and livelihoods are aligned with conservative values. As farmers and ranchers, they are going to vote in the interests of gun rights and land ownership.\\n\\nMany Mexican Americans in Uvalde are culturally Catholic, and a significant amount attend mass. Abortion is not going to be a make or break issue for them this cycle because they already lean against it anyway. However, they tend not to be the fire and brimstone evangelical type of conservative. Machismo culture is common in older generations, but is waning among younger people here.\\n\\nUvalde does not trust its police department. This is something the internet kind of got right. They are not happy, and are acting more belligerent towards its officers than before, or they were when I last spoke with my family.\\n\\nHowever, this is where I think the breakdown happens on how reddit believes Uvalde should respond. They are not going to vote against their own gun rights. Many of the people here do not give a flying fuck about Greg Abbott in their day to day lives. The govenor does not affect them, in their minds, on this granular of a level. Unless said governor started to campaign against guns.\\n\\nBecause, one, they are still culturally and practically attached to guns on a significant level. Their response to further threats against their community is to arm *themselves,* tell the police to fuck off, and handle community threats and breakdowns the same way they always have.\\n\\nOn their own.\\n\\nWhen talking about the shooter, a lot of emphasis is placed on his family. Where were they? Why were his parents such failures? His grandmother did the best she could. Ect. Mexican Americans in particular in Uvalde handle issues with individuals within the family. It is a common belief that if his parents were in his life, maybe we wouldn\\'t be here. I\\'m not going to say whether that view is correct or not, I\\'m providing it here to highlight that Uvalde is very self-reliant in this manner. They view the police as having failed them, so they are going to take care of themselves.\\n\\nWith all this said, Uvalde was *never* going to vote in masse for Beto because of his stance on guns. Abortion, the environment, property taxes, *none* of these things were their big ticket issue this election.\\n\\nGuns were.\\n\\nAgree with them or not, Uvalde is considered a \"large\" town in its area because it\\'s pretty much the largest town or city between itself and San Antonio. As it grew, it was self reliant and independent on most its needs as it developed. It is not and probably will never be a blue county and will not vote the way reddit or twitter or any left leaning social media site expects or wishes them to.\\n\\nThey are in many ways a conservative people in the same manner old school conservatives once were before radicals gained control of the GOP. The Mexican Americans here are by *no means* Trump or QAnon psychos the way current Republicans are. But they are not a left leaning people either.\\n\\nDemocrats can reach them and more parts of Texas if they field a candidate who is more realistic to Texas\\'s cowboy, independent, rugged past and mythos.\\n\\nI\\'m sure there are even more facets to how this vote turned out, but I wanted to post what I know of Uvalde because I am so fucking sick of ignorant posts (not so much this parent post) on this site and elsewhere posting complete bullshit about Uvalde, and for what? Upvotes? Clout? Because I don\\'t spot true empathy in them. If there were, they\\'d bother to learn at least *a little* about who they are. So many people have never been here or spoken to anyone from Uvalde, and it\\'s frustrating to read bad takes about them.',\n",

Harper is perhaps the most significant case of the U.S. Supreme Court term... At stake is the question of who runs U.S. elections and sets election law. \\n\\n> The stakes of the case couldn’t be higher. A decision in favor of the North Carolina legislators would essentially allow elected representatives to make whatever laws they want about elections. It would also give them license to ignore any state laws in setting the rules for elections. \\n\\n> But the argument in Moore v. Harper has another component: while Congress might be able to overrule state legislatures in setting the rules for elections, state courts cannot. If the plaintiffs are correct, then state legislatures can effectively ignore their own state laws and constitutions because the U.S. Constitution says legislatures should “prescribe” election law.\",\n",

       " \"So, there's a couple things at play here.  \\n  \\nLong story short, the midterms almost always result in a loss of seats for the party that holds the Presidency, and it's just a question of by how big the loss is.  At least in the modern political era there has only been one exception to this which is 2002 where the Democrats got completely wiped out because W had the 9/11 boost on his side, and there was a huge rally around the flag effect.  \\n  \\nOn top of that, Republican voters typically show up to midterms more often than Democrat voters, this has been the case basically since the 60's when you started getting the current day liberal/conservative splits in the parties.  The first time this effect hasn't been since since the days of LBJ's presidency was the 2018 midterms and now the 2022 midterms (I'm not sure on exact turnout yet, but early voting which is mostly Democrats broke 2018 records).  \\n  \\nAs such, as we went into midterms which are traditionally bad for Democrats for the previously mentioned reasons, there is a Democrat president which gives Republicans a boost.  Then Biden isn't really someone people are enthusiastic about, and largely ambivalent towards for his supporters which suppresses Democrat turnout, he's simply not a guy who generates hype.  \\n  \\nOn top of these issues you have national problems going on right now.  There is near double digit inflation happening which is normally a huge political issue (inflation ended Carters political career as well as Bush Sr, worries of inflation hamstrung Clinton, and fears of inflation both lead to the 2008 Obama supermajority and the subsequent wipeout of Democrats in each election after).  Then you have high gas prices, which are again a sensitive issue to people.  \\n  \\nOutside of highly visible issues like mentioned, the last two years have seen unprecedented levels of voter suppression measures taken.  Pennsylvania threw out a bunch of mail in ballots without telling people the day before election day, then forbid those people from voting in person.  Several districts had no process in place to resolve this.  Florida engaged in disenfranchisement by violating their felon voting rights reform, and then arresting people they said could vote.  Texas used a one size fits all approach to polling places, giving precincts of a couple thousand people the same numbers of machines, space, and poll workers as precincts with a 100,000 voters, and so on.  And of course there is the gerrymandered map issue such as states like Ohio and North Carolina which defended their redrawn districts in court, with the defense that the intent was to prevent Democrats from voting and winning elections, citing a SCOTUS ruling that drawing districts in a way to generate a partisan advantage is constitutional.   \\n  \\nAll of these things should have resulted in an absolute bloodbath for Democrats, and a huge win for Republicans.  Because of this, it's not really the end result that is being measured here, but rather that result against expectations based on the above as well as things such as polling data.    \\n  \\nTo say Republicans did bad in this election is an understatement.  They under performed relative to expectations by such a historically bad amount, that this is one of the worst election results in their parties history.  \\n  \\nThere's not really enough data in yet to give exact reasons (there's a lot of reasons, but how much each impacted voters is tough to say right now), but prior to last night, Republicans having 60 in the Senate and 260 in the House was legitimately on the table if they had a good night.  Instead they're in almost the same spot they were before the election, in what should have been a very favorable election for them.  \\n  \\nAnd that's before we get into the governor elections which was a another historically bad turnout for Republicans.  Republicans have held a huge advantage in gubernatorial races for decades, so much so that a major long term policy goal of the party was to control enough of those offices that they could call a convention of states and control the outcome.  They have been within striking distance of it multiple times.  Not a single incumbent lost their seat in elections this year, but all non incumbents went to Democrats, resulting in a gain of either 2 or 3 seats for Democrats (I think there's still one undecided looking at the results).  \\n  \\nPolling, political climate, timing, and so on should have had Republicans gain a large majority in the House and Senate while likely gaining a governor or two.  Instead they lost governor seats, aren't getting the Senate (and maybe even losing seats), and are getting what's looking to be an extremely narrow majority in the House.

DeSantis pretty much drew the map for Florida, which is why you saw so many seats there flip red. Its possible they would have still gone red given what happened in Miami-Dade, but it wouldnt have been by the margins we saw on election night. Georgia also has a gerrymandered map that all but assured that the results would be 9 R, 5 D (it used to be 8 R, 6 D before the redraw in 2020). I could go on...Most Dem states did not have as heavily gerrymandered maps, either because the courts rejected them (looking at you New York) or because they rely on nonpartisan commissions to draw the maps instead of partisan state legislatures. Focus on New York for just a second: Because Dems did not gerrymander that map as hard as they wanted to, Republicans were able to make several pickups there.

       " 'Okay, I think Im going to post a bit about Uvalde because there are so many misconceptions about this town on this site that it really bothers me. For background, my family is from Uvalde, my grandparents live two blocks behind Robb Elementary, and were probably fifth or sixth generation Mexican Americans dating back to Texass revolution. I didnt grow up in the town, my dad did, I did spend every summer there growing up, and go back every Christmas or Thanksgiving. I lay this out to be clear that while I am very familiar with the community, I do not live there and any one who does feel free to correct anything I post.First of all, there are two main demographics in Uvalde. Whites and Mexican Americans, the Mexican Americans I will focus the most on because I think this portion of the population is most misunderstood by reddit and the internet at large.The *vast* majority of Mexican Americans in this town are also fifth and sixth generation like my own family. This means that they are very Americanized and may not act how many of you expect. For a small example, the town itself is *not* pronounced by them the way TV anchors do it. You will not hear anyone there call it Oo-vall-deh but U-vahl-day. Yep, just like how white people say it.Uvalde has many farms, ranches, and deer leases in or around it. If you do not work for or own any of these land types, you know someone who does. Many of the people who live or work or have connections to these places use guns every single day for work, to protect livestock, or for food during hunting season.Uvalde is close to the border. While many people here do not hate illegal immigrants, they also are not particularly open to them either. The Mexican Americans here have issues with any perceived crimes that may or may not be committed by illegal immigrants. They dont want to see them mistreated necessarily, but they are also not of the mind that illegal immigrants are their \"people\" in the sense that immigrants are a make or break it voting issue for them.Following this point, Uvalde does not hate Border Patrol. Theyre actually very neutral towards it, and it is not uncommon for them to seek a career in their ranks. A few of the responding Border Patrol agents at Robb grew up in Uvalde.What do the people of Uvalde believe in? The *are* conservative in that many of their industry and livelihoods are aligned with conservative values. As farmers and ranchers, they are going to vote in the interests of gun rights and land ownership.Many Mexican Americans in Uvalde are culturally Catholic, and a significant amount attend mass. Abortion is not going to be a make or break issue for them this cycle because they already lean against it anyway. However, they tend not to be the fire and brimstone evangelical type of conservative. Machismo culture is common in older generations, but is waning among younger people here.Uvalde does not trust its police department. This is something the internet kind of got right. They are not happy, and are acting more belligerent towards its officers than before, or they were when I last spoke with my family.However, this is where I think the breakdown happens on how reddit believes Uvalde should respond. They are not going to vote against their own gun rights. Many of the people here do not give a flying fuck about Greg Abbott in their day to day lives. The govenor does not affect them, in their minds, on this granular of a level. Unless said governor started to campaign against guns.Because, one, they are still culturally and practically attached to guns on a significant level. Their response to further threats against their community is to arm *themselves,* tell the police to fuck off, and handle community threats and breakdowns the same way they always have.On their own.When talking about the shooter, a lot of emphasis is placed on his family. Where were they? Why were his parents such failures? His grandmother did the best she could. Ect. Mexican Americans in particular in Uvalde handle issues with individuals within the family. It is a common belief that if his parents were in his life, maybe we wouldnt be here. Im not going to say whether that view is correct or not, Im providing it here to highlight that Uvalde is very self-reliant in this manner. They view the police as having failed them, so they are going to take care of themselves.With all this said, Uvalde was *never* going to vote in masse for Beto because of his stance on guns. Abortion, the environment, property taxes, *none* of these things were their big ticket issue this election.Guns were.Agree with them or not, Uvalde is considered a \"large\" town in its area because its pretty much the largest town or city between itself and San Antonio. As it grew, it was self reliant and independent on most its needs as it developed. It is not and probably will never be a blue county and will not vote the way reddit or twitter or any left leaning social media site expects or wishes them to.They are in many ways a conservative people in the same manner old school conservatives once were before radicals gained control of the GOP. The Mexican Americans here are by *no means* Trump or QAnon psychos the way current Republicans are. But they are not a left leaning people either.Democrats can reach them and more parts of Texas if they field a candidate who is more realistic to Texass cowboy, independent, rugged past and mythos.Im sure there are even more facets to how this vote turned out, but I wanted to post what I know of Uvalde because I am so fucking sick of ignorant posts (not so much this parent post) on this site and elsewhere posting complete bullshit about Uvalde, and for what? Upvotes? Clout? Because I dont spot true empathy in them. If there were, theyd bother to learn at least *a little* about who they are. So many people have never been here or spoken to anyone from Uvalde, and its frustrating to read bad takes about them.',\n",

Harper is perhaps the most significant case of the U.S. Supreme Court term... At stake is the question of who runs U.S. elections and sets election law. > The stakes of the case couldn’t be higher. A decision in favor of the North Carolina legislators would essentially allow elected representatives to make whatever laws they want about elections. It would also give them license to ignore any state laws in setting the rules for elections. > But the argument in Moore v. Harper has another component: while Congress might be able to overrule state legislatures in setting the rules for elections, state courts cannot. If the plaintiffs are correct, then state legislatures can effectively ignore their own state laws and constitutions because the U.S. Constitution says legislatures should “prescribe” election law.',\n",

We will deal with a few nonsensical things coming out of a bare republican house, and probably a lot of interference with the debt ceiling, but the twice yearly impeachments are probably off the table.

       " 'The story is not so much the Repubs winning control of at least one house, which was a given, but that the supposed Red Wave never materialized.',\n",
       " 'So, theres a couple things at play here.    Long story short, the midterms almost always result in a loss of seats for the party that holds the Presidency, and its just a question of by how big the loss is.  At least in the modern political era there has only been one exception to this which is 2002 where the Democrats got completely wiped out because W had the 9/11 boost on his side, and there was a huge rally around the flag effect.    On top of that, Republican voters typically show up to midterms more often than Democrat voters, this has been the case basically since the 60s when you started getting the current day liberal/conservative splits in the parties.  The first time this effect hasnt been since since the days of LBJs presidency was the 2018 midterms and now the 2022 midterms (Im not sure on exact turnout yet, but early voting which is mostly Democrats broke 2018 records).    As such, as we went into midterms which are traditionally bad for Democrats for the previously mentioned reasons, there is a Democrat president which gives Republicans a boost.  Then Biden isnt really someone people are enthusiastic about, and largely ambivalent towards for his supporters which suppresses Democrat turnout, hes simply not a guy who generates hype.    On top of these issues you have national problems going on right now.  There is near double digit inflation happening which is normally a huge political issue (inflation ended Carters political career as well as Bush Sr, worries of inflation hamstrung Clinton, and fears of inflation both lead to the 2008 Obama supermajority and the subsequent wipeout of Democrats in each election after).  Then you have high gas prices, which are again a sensitive issue to people.    Outside of highly visible issues like mentioned, the last two years have seen unprecedented levels of voter suppression measures taken.  Pennsylvania threw out a bunch of mail in ballots without telling people the day before election day, then forbid those people from voting in person.  Several districts had no process in place to resolve this.  Florida engaged in disenfranchisement by violating their felon voting rights reform, and then arresting people they said could vote.  Texas used a one size fits all approach to polling places, giving precincts of a couple thousand people the same numbers of machines, space, and poll workers as precincts with a 100,000 voters, and so on.  And of course there is the gerrymandered map issue such as states like Ohio and North Carolina which defended their redrawn districts in court, with the defense that the intent was to prevent Democrats from voting and winning elections, citing a SCOTUS ruling that drawing districts in a way to generate a partisan advantage is constitutional.     All of these things should have resulted in an absolute bloodbath for Democrats, and a huge win for Republicans.  Because of this, its not really the end result that is being measured here, but rather that result against expectations based on the above as well as things such as polling data.      To say Republicans did bad in this election is an understatement.  They under performed relative to expectations by such a historically bad amount, that this is one of the worst election results in their parties history.    Theres not really enough data in yet to give exact reasons (theres a lot of reasons, but how much each impacted voters is tough to say right now), but prior to last night, Republicans having 60 in the Senate and 260 in the House was legitimately on the table if they had a good night.  Instead theyre in almost the same spot they were before the election, in what should have been a very favorable election for them.    And thats before we get into the governor elections which was a another historically bad turnout for Republicans.  Republicans have held a huge advantage in gubernatorial races for decades, so much so that a major long term policy goal of the party was to control enough of those offices that they could call a convention of states and control the outcome.  They have been within striking distance of it multiple times.  Not a single incumbent lost their seat in elections this year, but all non incumbents went to Democrats, resulting in a gain of either 2 or 3 seats for Democrats (I think theres still one undecided looking at the results).    Polling, political climate, timing, and so on should have had Republicans gain a large majority in the House and Senate while likely gaining a governor or two.  Instead they lost governor seats, arent getting the Senate (and maybe even losing seats), and are getting whats looking to be an extremely narrow majority in the House.  As far as results go for Republicans, this is awful.  Oh, they lost several state legislatures too.Edit:  Couple small edits to add some more historical context that puts the shifts into perspective.',\n",
