# Task 1 - Gather data
To gather data about the top five hot topics in a city, I found news portals to be the most relevant source. Therefore, I scraped Times of India to search for any news related to the city and extracted the titles. Although I attempted to gather data from other sources, including Google Trends, I found that they didn't provide relevant data. Hence, I decided to stick to the news portal for now.

# Task 2 - Gather relevant discussions
After obtaining the news titles, I searched for these topics on Twitter and extracted all the posts and their comments. To ensure comprehensive coverage and a substantial dataset, I scraped data from all available sources on Twitter. Finally, I stored the collected data in a JSON file.

Similarly, I used PRAW(Python Reddit API Wrapper) to search for the extracted data from news portals on the Reddit platform and extract the top 3 posts and their comments using Reddit API pp. Finally, I stored all the collected data, including both the Twitter and Reddit data, in the same JSON file.

# Task 3 - Analyze gathered information
After collecting the data and public discussions on these topics, I perform data preprocessing, which includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and other data processing methods. This involves removing tags and comment strings, as well as unnecessary strings like '/n' and skip sequences.

To analyze the sentiment in the comments for the given posts, I use the TextBlob library. TextBlob is a Python library for processing textual data. It provides simple API methods for common natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis. By leveraging TextBlob, I performed the sentiment analysis (positive, negative, or neutral) of the comments in the dataset.

# Task 4 - Build a small front-end to display your analyzed information
I have built a small UI using Streamlit in Python, where users can input the city name. The UI includes dropdowns for selecting various news sources. Upon submitting the city name and selecting the desired sources, the UI displays the top 5 headlines from those sources. Additionally, it extracts comments and posts from Reddit and Twitter for further analysis.
Internally, the application processes this information and performs sentiment analysis. The results of the sentiment analysis are then visualized using a bar graph, showing the number of positive, negative, and neutral comments
